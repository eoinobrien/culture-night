    "description": "CULTURE NIGHT, FRIDAY 20th September 2024 at 8pm.\nThe Dominican 800th, Drogheda 1294-2024\nDrogheda's Musicians and Poets perform in a\nFREE CONCERT at the Augustinian Church, Shop St.\n''Poems, Bells and Synths''\nThe Augustinian Church in Shop St, possesses a unique Bell Tree of 40 chimes which is used during mass and rituals. The Bell Tree is tuned to C and G pentatonic scales. Michael Holohan, composer, will premiere a new work called Sounds from a Cloister using the bells to commemorate 800 years of the Dominican Order in Drogheda (1224-2024). The piece will be celebratory in nature and will acknowledge the great contribution of the Dominicans to the history of medieval Drogheda and not forgetting the huge contribution also made by The Augustinian and Franciscan orders. The composition will integrate the sounds of the other church bells of Drogheda i.e. the bells of St. Peter's Church of Ireland, St. Peter's Catholic Church and The Tholsel. The sounds of these bells will be recorded on tape and mixed with the live sounds in the church. This live performance will be accompanied by percussion. The audience will be surrounded with 'retro synthesiser sounds', percussion and bells thus giving our listeners a unique experience of 'spatial music.'\nThe performers will be Breifne Holohan, John Mc Crea, Grace Dillon, Trudy Maguire, Martin Shields, Joanne Kieran, Juliet Barrow, Barry Leahy, Stephen Higgins, Brendan Leahy and Michael Holohan, artistic director.\nSJ Mc Ardle, singer songwriter, will perform songs from his CD and song cycle Port.\nThe composer Breifne Holohan will perform pieces for electric guitar and electronics including Guth na Gaoithe, an improvisation featuring samples of Bronze age horns by Ancient Music Ireland.\nBetween the musical items readings will be given by the widely published Drogheda poets Susan Connolly, Roger Hudson, Emir Ní Daibhís, Paddy Dillon, John O'Rourke and Tomas De Faoite.\nWith the support of Create Louth and Culture Night\nAdmission: Free , no booking required. A wine reception will take place after the concert",

Dealing with the death of his younger brother, he is struggling to come to terms with all that he is, and everything that he’s not. Working as a customer support advisor in a call centre at a bin disposal company and experiencing many different escapades with his best friend Pauline, Malachy is eager to take some time to reflect on and move on with his life. He quickly comes to realise, however, that it’s not as easy as it seems on paper. A play about growing up, and the lessons we learn along the way.\n\nWritten & performed by Conor Burke, who received a nomination for the Micheál Mac Liammóir Award for Outstanding Lead Performance by an Actor in a Play at the 2023 International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival and directed by IFTA nominee Lesley Conroy.

To tackle the crisis, Herbert Simms was appointed the city’s first housing architect in the early 1930s. In a sixteen year period between 1932 and 1948, he and his Dublin Corporation team built an astounding 17,000 homes, some as inner city flat complexes and others as houses in newly-created suburbs such as Crumlin and Cabra.\n\nLike the city’s acclaimed Georgian squares, the Simms-designed Corporation flats in particular have stood the test of time, adding a touch of Art Deco and Modernist glamour to the inner city streets and, not before time, a number of them have been added to the city’s list of protected structures in recent year.\n\nIn this talk, St Mobhi's Parish take a look at Simms work and consider what can be learned from the 1930s approach to a severe urban housing crisis.",

The project examines the relationship between the islands of Ireland and their natural environment and puts our islands’ diverse communities, culture, and experiences right at the centre of the discourse surrounding our shared future.\n\nCurated by a team of five architects: Peter Carroll, Peter Cody, Elizabeth Hatz, Mary Laheen, and Joseph Mackey; Ireland’s national pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2023, In Search of Hy-Brasil, derives from an intense engagement with the islands of Ireland and is a direct provocation to all of us to reimagine the vast combined territory of land and ocean we call our home.\n\nWe are an island nation facing an uncertain future. The challenges of climate change, renewable energy, ethical food production and biodiversity must be met quickly, with purpose, renewing the lost equilibrium between ourselves and the natural world. In making this adjustment, our islands’ inventiveness in the face of adversity and creativity in response to having less provides us with the necessary tools and narratives to inspire more sustainable ways of living.\n\nJoin us on Culture Night 2024 for Island Celebrations! Follow @ArchAtTheEdge for updates.",

This year, artist Jialin Long has conceived the flag designs using the idea of the landmark as a witness, inspired by the Ha'penny Bridge in Dublin.\n\n‘Water symbolises the flow of people travelling from one place to another, while the bridge\nrepresents the connection between different cultures, fostering friendship and understanding. In my studio in Temple Bar, I am continually fascinated by the diverse crowd passing each day. The Ha'penny Bridge stands as a silent observer of the unique stories and backgrounds of every individual who crosses it.’\n\nThe flags can be seen flying over the Liffey on Wellington Quay for the month of September. There will be an accompanying drop-in workshop at Temple Bar Gallery + Studios on Culture Night.",

It also draws inspiration from the legend of Princess Beara, the Spanish Princess who it is said married Owen Mór, King of Ireland, around 120 AD and who gave the area its name.\n\nThe project has been showcased at the Irish Embassy UK, Dublin City Assembly House, London Irish Centre, Tuamgraney Harp Festival, Return to London Town Festival, the Wales International Harp Festival, Kenmare Buttermarket, Cornstown House and the World Harp Congress, Cardiff, generously supported by Culture Ireland. The album was recorded on location in Dawros Church, Co. Kerry by producer Laoise O' Brien and engineer Ben Rawlins and is funded by Kerry County Council Arts, Small Investments Ltd., the Wales International Harp Festival and Beara Distillery.\n\nA multiple prize winner, Tara has performed and recorded at venues including the Wigmore Hall, Abbey Road Studios, the National Concert Hall Dublin, Áras an Uachtaráin, St John's Smith Square, the Mansion House and the Irish Embassy in London.\n\nSeven times All-Ireland Champion, Robert released his critically acclaimed solo flute album Feochán in 2020. He has toured internationally with Dónal Lunny’s band Cíorras, the Traditional Arts Collective, The Katerina Garcia Band and The National Folk Orchestra of Ireland.\n\nFor any queries please contact westwicklowfestival@gmail.com.",

Roscommon by the County Leitrim Percy French Society.\n\nThe County Leitrim Percy French Society was formed by Tish Dunleavy and Frank Cadam as they realised that, despite his extensive musical repertoire French was under-appreciated and under-promoted. The society have performed in theatres all across the country, including two sell-out shows in the National Concert Hall, the show is performed by nine members of the Society in period costume with Frank Cadam taking the role of the great man himself, in a manner authentic to the spirit and arrangements in which French himself performed. From the moment the curtains rise the audience will be transported to a world of laughter, song and timeless story telling. The talented performers breathe life into Percy French's classic works with unparalleled passion and finesse. Their dedication to preserving Irish culture and heritage shines brightly in every note sung and every line delivered. The show is a delightful journey through the whimsical landscapes of Irish folklore and the tender moments of everyday life, all expertly woven together by the society's skilled actors and performers. From uproarious comedy to poignant ballads, each item is executed with precision and heart, eliciting a range of emotions from captivated audiences. The event will serve as a joyous celebration of the 170th anniversary of Percy French's birth.",

The students pride themselves on giving concerts from an early age in order to develop their technique and performance skills. In the group, all types of music are encouraged and Culture Night is a fantastic opportunity for them to show their enthusiasm and demonstration their interest in musical diversity. Come along to hear Bach's Double Violin concerto, Irish and European folk music, as well as a collaboration with Irish dancers for some reels and jigs. \n\nThe Suzuki philosophy is based on the mother tongue method, where parents are involved in the lesson by observing and working on the detail of the lesson with the child when practicing at home. Progress is not an accomplishment of big steps but rather, each small achievement is praised. Students are encouraged to do continuous workshops, concerts and graduations to motivate their practice. The ability to practice is not a natural effort but it is developed by praise and encouragement, mostly given at concerts. Some of the students you will hear have participated in workshops in Ireland and abroad and also have preformed in the Royal Albert Hall in London.",

The workshop will be a mix of hand and machine sewing, showing you how to be more sustainable with your textile items.

Geometric forms and underlying structures are frequent elements, but not to the exclusion of other organic shapes and mark making. Such approaches connect the work to visual art movements and music developments of the 20th century, but also to some of the oldest known paintings in human cultures around the world.",

This initiative unites a diverse group of young people from Galway City to address the challenges faced by their peers with physical disabilities.\n\nIn May 2023, a Youth Access Consultation was held to hear from young people with disabilities about their experiences in public and social spaces in Galway. Following this, funding from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) was secured to create this documentary.\n\nThe Youth Access Project aims to combat ableism and promote inclusivity. This documentary, crafted by young people, takes the audience on a journey with its participants, who share honest testimonies of living with a disability. Their personal stories highlight the barriers they encounter and the impact these obstacles have on their social interactions, raising awareness and advocating for more accessible environments.\n\nSince October 2023, these dedicated young filmmakers have worked tirelessly, conducting interviews and filming. Nova Productions is leading the project under the direction of award-winning filmmaker Teresa Lavina, ensuring a professional and impactful final product.\n\n'Breaking Barriers: Access for All' is a testament to the power of youth voices in driving social change. Join us in supporting accessibility and inclusivity for all young people.",

The album serves as both a celebration of Bianca's 14th anniversary as an immigrant in Ireland and a recognition of the rich tapestry of Irish and South American cultures.\nInspired by the notion that music can transport us through time, \"Time Machine\" is a captivating blend of ancient Irish influences, Brazilian roots, contemporary and various rhythms. Bianca's deep connection to her native South America infuses the album with tropical warmth while maintaining a delicate balance between Brazilian music, Irish music, folk, soul and jazz elements.\n\"This album is a labour of love, a tribute to the transformative power of music,\" says Bianca. \"It's a reflection of my journey as an immigrant and a celebration of the diverse music times that have shaped my identity.\"\nWith its unique blend of musical styles and heartfelt storytelling, \"Time Machine\" promises to be a standout debut from one of Ireland's most promising new talents. Don't miss your chance to experience Bianca's captivating musical journey – step into the \"Time Machine\" and let the music carry you away.",

This small child or doll’s garment is constructed from honeybees, wax, cotton and wire and reflects on themes associated with feminism, mythology and childhood.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to view ‘Bee Dress’ on display for a limited time and hear from the artist herself about the materials, inspiration and processes involved in creating this thought-provoking artwork.\n\nFor further details, see - https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Country-Life/Events/2024/Q3-2024/Culture-Night-Oiche-Chultuir-2024",

    "description": "Opening of the exhibition 'Unreality' by artist Michaela McCann, at Alliance Française de Cork:\nMichaela McCann’s work explores absurdity and unreality through the medium of oil painting and photography. Through the use of techniques such as disjunction and displacement, Michaela conveys a sense of unreality in her work. The imagery in her work creates irrational and dream-like compositions, giving the work a sense of other-worldliness. Michaela takes inspiration from everyday life, often photographing objects or settings and taking them out of their usual contexts and then combining and juxtaposing them together in order to give the work a bizarre quality and provoke thought in the viewer. Through her work, Michaela aims to challenge social institutions by rejecting the logic and rationality of everyday life and instead embrace the nonsensical.",

Screening of an interview with members of Frybrook House will be exhibited on the night, to enhance the visual work on display. The house also supplied soup to the locals during the Great Famine (1845 to 1852), evidenced by a very large Famine Cauldron in the kitchen.\n\nThe gallery looks forward to exploring the Great Famine through various mediums.

This tradition not only embraces but celebrates the arts, integrating them into the very fabric of Buddhist practice as well as the vibrant culture of the Dublin Buddhist Centre.\n\nThrough Buddhist practice, the worlds of myth, imagination, and archetype come alive. For many people, this can produce a profound encounter with the transcendental.\n\nThere will be a reception with light refreshments as well as an introduction by Prasannadeva in conversation with some of the artists showcased.",

Distillation is a response to the recent cessation of the peat harvesting industry in Ireland.\n\nOver the past year, Luke Casserly has collaborated with renowned perfume maker Joan Woods to create a unique distillation of the Midlands bog – the place where he grew up – as the starting point for an olfactory encounter which looks at our human relationship to place. Dedicated to the future of our broken landscapes – in the hope that by listening to them, we might be able to better understand them.\n\nPart lecture, part performance, the project is an ambitious attempt to look at our human relationship to landscape through scent. As an artist from the Irish Midlands, Luke was inspired to make the piece in response to the recent cessation of the peat harvesting industry, as a way of stretching out further conversations around the environmental potential of the Irish bog landscape.\n\nLuke has collaborated with renowned perfume maker Joan Woods over the past year to create a unique distillation of the Irish bog, the starting point for an olfactory performance which attempts to translate the landscape for a live audience in an intimate and inventive way. Each audience member will be invited to smell the custom-made perfume as part of the performance.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut Irland, with additional development support by IMMA, Druid FUEL, NTE and Backstage Theatre’s Activate Residency programme.",

Contemporary dance is an expressive style that combines elements of several dance genres including modern, Jazz, Lyrical and Classical Ballet. BOLD will also feature two duets.",

Maireann a cháil sa tseanchas i measc an phobail agus i measc muintir Shuibhne atá fós breá bríomhar in iarthar Chonamara. Scríobh an staraí Hardiman faoi sa mbliain 1846 agus bhailigh Tomás Ó Máille a chuid amhráin ón bpobal don leabhar Micheál Mac Suibhne agus Filidh an tSléibhe i 1934. Tiocfaidh aisteoirí, fonnadóirí agus gaolta leis an tSuibhneach le chéile lena shaol agus a shaothar a cheiliúradh. Páirteach beidh Cumann Dramaíochta Chorr na Móna, Máirín Uí Chéide, Orla Ní Fhinneadha, Seán O Coistealbha, Colm Seoighe agus Micheál O Gionnáin.

While entertaining it also preserves the oral traditions that form an integral part of Ireland, stories often passed through generation with a unique local identity.\n\nMoving outdoors to Back Lane we have planned a lively session of traditional Irish music featuring local practitioners. This session will feature the haunting melodies of fiddles, tin whistles, bodhráns and accordions. This spontaneous expression of Irish music will breathe life into the very air, captivating the community and creating intimate connections between musicians and listeners.\n\nFollowing the session we return inside for Sean Nòs, an unaccompanied vocal style of singing deeply rooted in Irish Tradition. Known for its intricate ornamentation and free rhythm, Sean Nòs singing conveys profound emotion and narrative through its unique delivery.\n\nTraditional Story Telling\n9:00pm - 9:30pm\n\nTraditional Irish Music Session\n10:00pm - 11:30pm\n\nSean Nos\n11:45pm - 12:15am",

With a reputation for pushing the boundaries of sound, their setup will transform the plaza into a high-energy haven that is true to the roots of soundsystem culture.\n\nt-woc is an Irish producer & DJ known for blending genres, both in his own productions and his DJ sets.

She is the founder of foxgluv and was a participant in the Skin & Blister DJ workshops. Her style combines a mix of bass-heavy genres such as afro/caribbean inspired riddims, UKg, breaks, grime, drums, baile funk, and more.\n\nIn addition to his hard-won mad-skills behind the decks, Jonezy’s vast horde of ridiculous records is as fine an anthology as any in Ireland. Soulful reggae classics, hidden jungle gems, the latest Manchester hybrid halftime weapon – Jonezy mashes the dance and puts it back together with ease. In 2010, Jonezy launched his own promotion concept, Riseup! to explore a broader take on modern rave sounds and bring key, cutting edge acts to Cork. With his dad, a trained chippy, Jonezy built The RiseUp!

    "description": "Goodcellas is a friendly ensemble of members of the cello section of Cork Fleischmann Symphony Orchestra, playing music from their wide repertoire. Goodcellas will run from 7-7.40pm.\nA uniquely fascinating aural journey through the Irish 20th century, in collaboration with IndieCork Film Festival will take place from 8-9.30pm. Selecting from his vinyl archive of rare 20th century Irish Classical Music, music expert John Byrne is our insightful and encyclopedic guide. John writes, I would lay claim for the beginning of the Irish 20th century as being in 1936, the year that a young gay Irish composer called Frederick May found himself fleeing Austria and the spreading tentacles of Fascism. His reaction was the penning of his 'String Quartet In C Minor'. The creation of indigenous Classical composition went very literally technicolor with the scribing of this piece. But no-one noticed at the time. Why? The answer comes down to intentional state policy. The music went unsupported by state decree. Things slowly changed in the latter decades of the last century with the appearance of Irish Classical performers and composition on records. And thus the proper beginning of our aural story. This presentation will give you the emergence of a genre of music in recorded form. Accompanying visuals by IndieCork's Tony Langlois.\n\nMusic - Cork Cello Collective plus Vinyl Archive",

The name captures perfectly humanity’s place in space and time in the vastness of the universe and the delicate nature of our important relationship with our planet.\n\nThere will be five shows across the evening and screenings will be of approximately 20 minutes duration. Each show will be filled on a first come, first served basis with plenty of other activities to do during the evening. Ballycroy Women’s Group will present World Food Night concurrently at the Community Centre, providing food and hospitality prepared especially for the evening. All are welcome.\n\nFor Culture Night, an especially designed \"Star Trail\" will also be available to experience and it will guide visitors to enjoy ample stargazing (weather dependent), biodiversity and indoor activities, as well as a dark skywalk, adjacent to the visitor centre of the National Park. At the Wild Nephin National Park Visitor Centre Special Astronomy introductions, both English and As Gaeilge will be screened on repeat adjacent to indoor astronomy activities, while at the Outdoor Classroom, will be the Under One Sky multi-sensory experience with sensory trail, telescopes and observation. For the late night owls, there will be a Dark Sky/ Stargazing Walk at 10.30pm, which will be a looped walk of approx. 1.5km (weather permitting).",

    "description": "6aside is a photography series capturing in-game, first-person point of view action from Cork's community and street league football tournament.\n\nEach week, a different player from one of the participating teams wears a body-mounted camera while playing in a different position, capturing their personal in-game experience. The resulting series tells a cohesive story of often-overlooked moments in small-sided football, while emphasising the power of football to unite diverse communities in a rapidly changing Ireland.\n\nThis year-round event takes place in The Glen, Cork city, and features players from various social and marginalised backgrounds, including those in supported accommodation, individuals at risk of or formerly experiencing homelessness, recovering addicts, residents from two international accommodation centres, former residents who have gained residency, Travelers, members of Cork's Polish, Italian, and Spanish communities, unemployed young men from the city's northside, members of the LGBTI community, support workers, journalists, and more.\n\nThe idea of passing the camera to different players was inspired by Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama’s concept of “photography by feel.” Moriyama, known for shooting without using the viewfinder, captures images based on instinct and emotion. Series curator and photographer Paul Carroll adopted this concept, entrusting his camera to a different player each week. Moreover, he involved the players in the editing and selection process.\n\nThe resulting work is a participant-driven, serendipitous blend of sport and street photography, offering a portrait of both the struggles and joys of the game as the seasons pass. It celebrates Ireland’s dynamic, vibrant, and evolving landscape while dramatizing the power of community through sport.\n\nThe Culture Night 2024 one-night installation of 6aside pays homage to Carroll's teenage obsession with football in a culturally homogeneous 1990's Ireland. Instead of posters of star footballers on his bedroom wall, this exhibition showcases members of Cork's Community and street Leagues. It encapsulates an open, multicultural, and inclusive Ireland, underscoring how sport often leads the way in reflecting societal change.\n\nExhibition space: A fully interactive experience featuring a foosball table for visitors to enjoy, along with a computer setup and gamepads for playing the classic video game Sensible Soccer.",

Known for their vibrant and positive energy, the group have performed on stage with Damien Rice at Cork Opera House and with Eimear Crehan at the Marina Market Cork.\n\nReadings from Cork stories - 18:45 to 19:15\nA reading from Cork Stories (Doire Press, 2024), an anthology of short fiction set in various locations in Cork City and County Cork, by writers who live or have lived in Cork.\n\nELLES MITRAILLENT EXHIBITION - 17:00 to 20:30\nThe aim of our project is to give a voice to women photographers so that they can free their artistic expression and, through their photographs, convey the changes that have affected their lives and share the everyday moments and decisive experiences of recent years.Our trademark is to have our photos printed on large curtains, the works exude lightness and fluidity, marking the spirit and enriching the visitor's experience. Visitors always love to “get into the photographs”.\n\nIrene Kelleher Performance - 19:30 to 20:00\nFootnote is a one-woman comedy, told from the point of view of Noreen Gilhooly, a long struggling writer who works in her local bookshop for the past ten years ago. Noreen dreams of emulating the success of her mother, the famous poet, author and feminist-activist Genevieve de Lacy. Living in her mother’s shadow hasn’t been easy, from ex-boyfriends reciting her mother’s poetry in the bedroom to customers educating her on who her mother ‘really’ was. But Noreen isn’t her mother, more into dismantling a ‘World-Book Day’ stand than the patriarchy, her only edge is refusing to floss her teeth and her greatest talent might be alphabetising the children’s section. But with the promise of a publication finally pending Noreen has to decide, is she ready to take her place amongst the literary greats or remain her mother’s footnote.\n\nJimmy Crowley and Eve Telford; an evening of music - 20:00 to 20:45\nCome along and hear Eve Telford and Jimmy Crowley sing a selection of our Cork favorites and some Ceol and Lore is guaranteed , we are looking forward to what is guaranteed to be a great event.\n\nHarp, voice and flute performance - 16:00 to 16:45\nNancy and Miriam Long of Ceolann, are a talented, versatile harp, voice and flute duo, who enthrall and delight audiences throughout West Cork and Munster.Nancy is the musical director of both the Skibbereen Cathedral Choir and Enchant Choral Group.She is an accomplished harpist, organist and vocalist.",

    "description": "Scéalaíocht agus Ceol le Julie Ann De Brún 6.00-7.00 followed by a Literary panel discussion featuring renowned Poet Emily Cullen and Authors Elizabeth Reapy and Edel Coffey.\n\nEmily Cullen is a remarkable poet who has contributed to various commemorative projects. One of her poems, “Roller Skating in Kilmainham,” reflects on the life of Grace Gifford Plunkett, who married Joseph Plunkett in Kilmainham Gaol during the tumultuous period of Irish history. The poem captures the emotions and struggles of that time. Her third poetry collection, “Conditional Perfect” (2019), received acclaim and was included in The Irish Times’ roundup of the best new poetry of that year. Elizabeth Reapy is known for her novels, including “Red Dirt” (2016) and “Skin” (2019). These works explore themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth. “Red Dirt” is set in Australia and follows the lives of three Irish friends who emigrate there. It delves into their struggles, dreams, and the challenges they face in a foreign land. “Skin” is a powerful novel that examines the complexities of mental health and self-discovery. Edel Coffey’s novel “Breaking Point” (2022) garnered much attention. It’s a gripping suspense story that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. Her second novel, “In Her Place” (2024), is set in New York and revolves around Ann, who becomes entangled in a complicated relationship after her mother’s death. When Ann meets Justin, a grieving man whose wife is still alive but gravely ill, their lives take unexpected turns.\n\nThe novel explores love, loss, and the choices we make when faced with difficult circumstances. These authors have contributed significantly to contemporary Irish literature, and their works offer diverse perspectives and engaging storytelling.\n\nThis event is a panel discussion and will be chaired by Emily Cullen.",

Join our expert guides for an engaging tour of the Casino, where you will discover the incredible design and history of this hidden gem.\n\nGuided tours will take place at 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm, and 7 pm during Culture Night.\n\nTickets for the tours are free but must be booked in advance through Eventbrite",

Semple also designed churches at Whitechurch, Kilternan, Tallaght, St Mary’s Chapel of Ease (Black Church), Abbeyleix and Killeshin. When the church opened on Christmas Day 1831, the Dublin Penny Journal claimed that \"There was not a spot in the church where the eye can rest without pain\"!\n\n100 years later, Sir John Betjeman described it as ‘a cheerful Irish castle with a seaside rather than a fortress flavour’.\n\nWe invite you to come and visit the church and decide for yourself whether the above descriptions adequately describe this extraordinary building. The church is partially wheelchair accessible. Free guide leaflets, quizzes for adults and treasure hunts and quizzes for children will be available.",

A Record of Tenderness by Richard Malone is a powerful exploration of labour and class through sculpture, performance, film and a site-specific mural at The Dock. CREATION by Deborah Kelly unfurls across generations, identities, artforms and places, and changes with each iteration, acquiring songs, congregants, iconography, poems, recipes, rules. Both artists celebrate the queer imagination.\n\nHow Can One Not Love You 2.0\nIconic short films from Ukraine\nPerformance Space, 7pm\n\nHow Can One Not Love You 2.0 is a selection of iconic short films about Kyiv.

    "description": "Elaine Quinlan – Exhibition Launch, 4-7pm\n\nThe Leitrim Design House is delighted to showcase a new exhibition Elaine Quinlan, an Irish artist living and working in rural Galway.\n\nShe paints in her studio in an area known for its marshy lowlands, rocky limestone fields and turloughs. These turloughs or vanishing lakes are the inspiration for her work, which lies somewhere between abstraction and representation. Pools, reflections, straggly grasses and mossy lichens are regular motifs in her paintings.\n\nWorking in either oils or acrylics, she builds up layers of paint with lots of glazing and delicate mark-making to create colourful, ethereal paintings on wood panels and canvas.\n\nLiving close to the Burren has also inspired her to create smaller works exploring a more graphic style - little snapshots of the colours and shapes she sees in the landscape there.\n\nDrop-in Workshop Scarf Puppets with Rose Minnema, 4-7pm\n\nRose Minnema is a puppet builder and facilitates workshops to create puppets and manipulating them. Puppetry is a beautiful medium to express oneself and explore themes such as biodiversity, racial diversity and one's identity in a safe and playful way. Respect, compassion, joy and a sense of wonder about life are key elements in my work and I like to transmit that during the workshops by stimulating participants to get actively involved and use their imagination.\n\nDuring this drop-in workshop in The Leitrim Design House Rose will make a selection of medium size scarf puppets. Participants will first assemble the puppets and afterwards there will be a possibility the play with them. This will give the participants a great opportunity to see something of the process of making puppets and get a sense of manipulating them. All ages are welcome to join this exciting interactive workshop.",

The film is one component part of the multidisciplinary event of the same name, which also incorporates performance, music, song, painting and poetry. It took place at The New Theatre in Dublin last March opening on Luxemburgs birthday (5th March) and ran for 3 nights. It is a collaboration between Douglas Henderson - composer, singer/songwriter, musician, performer and translator and Noël O’Callaghan - visual artist, performer, singer/musician and text writer.\nInspired by the poem ‘du liegst/you lie’ from German-Jewish poet Paul Celan, music, painting and poetry creates a lyrical homage to Luxemburg and her message of anti-militarism. This was filmed along the Landwehr Canal in Berlin where Rosa's body was thrown following her murder at the hand of the far-right Freicorps. White Feathers collected from the Berlin canal swans symbolise the struggle for peace during WWI. Juxtaposed with Emmeline Pankhurst’s White Feather Campaign, they transform this erstwhile badge of shame into a symbol of defiance and peace in Rosa's name.\nA selection of paintings from the Feathers for Rosa exhibition will also be displayed and the artists will be present to answer questions on Luxemburg, Paul Celan and their life in Berlin before and after the fall of the wall.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thesketchoftheday/\n\nStudio 3: Mark Beatty\n‘Using a map, projector and Google Maps Street View I offer participants the chance to travel on The 'Purple' Road and see West Cork in a new light.’\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thepurpleroad/",

    "description": "Last year we successfully produced a short ﬁlm and held a screening for Culture Night, 'Our Treasure, The Curragh of Kildare'. This achievement motivated us to apply for the Heritage Keepers course for 2024, which we completed with the Burren Beo trust of the Heritage Council. As part of our “actions” we are producing a podcast series, one of the course outcomes. For Culture night 2024 we plan to host Curragh Chronicles, Uisce Domhain Curragh Heritage Keepers; discussion and digital exhibition and record the discussions as an episode.\n\nThis podcast series along with other projects we have undertaken as Heritage Keepers will be published on our developing website. We will be recording the series in many places and spaces all centred around the Curragh, including some “ﬁreside chats” in the Croft Inn to chronicle The Curragh.\n\nThis podcast episode, Curragh Culture Night, will cover various aspects of the Curragh of Kildare including cultural, environmental, natural and built heritage, surrounding the it. We will host an open panel discussion, recording the session for publication. Additionally we will issue an open call for a digital exhibition to be held in conjunction with the event, inviting creatives of all kinds and ages to share their work inspired by Curragh of Kildare. The many works will be presented in the venue including imagery connected to our Heritage Keeping through digital screens and projections.",

It was within reggae dance culture he met Salim, an Irish-Malaysian producer and composer.\n\nA collaboration was formed and the mighty Damai Sound was born. In the mix, bringing the mic to life is Aminah whose own soulful free-style jam complements this roots experience.

The current exhibition Possible Life is a series of large ‘punk zen’ Indian brush drawings on water colour paper by artist Chris Doris.\n\nThese large circular works of art are ambiguous, alluding to cellular and planetary cosmic fields of becoming. The images are informed by the artist’s long experience as a meditator and psychotherapist in Western and Buddhist psychology. The works rest on the contemplative seeing of somatic and cosmic fields – macro and micro.",

Directed and choreographed by David Bolger, this show unites two of Ireland's most exciting performers, Stephanie Dufresne and Alex O’Neill for the very first time – in an intimate duet that grooves between hope and the dystopia of an angry world.\n\nIt's 2024 and the witching hour. As dusk approaches, the doors of the hall are flung wide open. You are invited to enter. Two enigmatic dancers hit the dance floor – quietly questioning their hopes and dreams amongst the surrounding turmoil. As their shadows deepen, they take more chances and dance more dances – “where are we headed to, where does it all end?”",

How can one emulate Whitman and \"\"sing oneself\"\", when speaking out is dangerous?\n\nThis theatrical adaptation of the poetry of local poet Denise Garvey combines poetic text with live performance & musicianship to innovate new ways of delivering literary work. It is\na preview of a longer piece currently in development, and explores themes of belonging, patriarchy, difference, striving, and the fertile place where language, music and embodiment intersect.\n\nAs a theatre director, Sarah O'Toole enjoys working with ensemble performers to find unique ways of staging poetry. Thanks to an Arts Council Agility Award, she and four actor-musicians spent a weekend earlier this year exploring performance approaches to Denise's work, and we are very looking forward to giving audiences a taste of our explorations upstairs at The Mick Lally Theatre at 8pm on Culture Night.\n\nWe are very grateful to Galway City Council & The Mick Lally Theatre & Kumon City West for their support in delivering this exciting cross-disciplinary event.",

Tá Rónán Ó Conghaile i mbun damhsa sean-nós le roinnt blianta anuas, d’éirigh leis Comórtas Steip a bhaint amach ag Oireachtais na Samhna. Chomh maith le sin, bíonn Rónán ag casadh amhráin sean-nóis, tá sé ag obair ar a seacht ndícheall leis an traidisiún a choinneáil beo beathach don chéad ghlúin eile. Tá mise ag casadh amhráin ó bhí mé an-óg, tá an traidisiún tagtha anuas tríd glúnta na gCeannabháin uilig ó Mháire Ghabha & Michael Mháire Ghabha. Tá mé féin, Mick Connelly agus David Munnelly ag ceol lena chéile le bliain anuas. Rinne muid camchuairt bheag timpeall na hÉireann agus Stiúideo Cuan ina measc. Bheadh muid lán sásta an maoiniú a fháil ionas go dtig linn leanúint ar aghaidh ag ardú spiorad agus croíthe an pobal go léir.",

The workshop aims to highlight and generate discussion on town-wide accessibility issues, starting at the front steps of Kunstverein Aughrim. Participants will assemble and test a temporary access ramp in the form of a drawbridge that can be inserted into a building's threshold. As part of the workshop, Kunstverein Aughrim and Howff will present their learning following a year-long Accessibility Study of Aughrim (titled Suppose a Stone) that encompassed a series of surveys and activity maps, a Sensory Walk, and a Walkability Study. Suppose a Stone was a collaboration between Aughrim Tidy Towns CLG, Aughrim Active Retirement Group, Kunstverein Aughrim and Howff Architects, supported by the Irish Architecture Foundation’s Reimagine Hometown Architect initiative. Findings will be shared for future learning.\n\nThis workshop takes place from 2-5 pm.\n\nBooking will be available via Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1002312843697?aff=oddtdtcreator\n\nFor any queries please see https://kunstverein.ie/Drawbridge-Workshop\n\nBooking Email Address: office@kunstverein.ie",

It is the presence of justice\nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThis is a dance event/workshop led by Bernadette Divilly, dance movement artist who specialises in socially-engaged practices centred on the body-mind relationship.\n\nThis event involves audience engagement and participation in investigating the conditions essential for the presence of peace. It includes somatic explorations, improvisational dance scores and deep listening. We will contemplate what it means to do no harm. We will explore breathable boundaries, power, language differences and cultural conditions.\n\nAudience engagement is central and participatory every step of the way, focusing on connection between the human nervous system and co-creating through movement. We will investigate how an exploration of knowing justice is essential to our health, wellbeing and survival while honouring that we are all interconnected.\n\nSome parts of the event will be documented and shared digitally.\n\nSupported by Galway Dance",

This immersive promenade performance unveils four spellbinding narratives, each unfolding in distinct corners of the garden, marrying the mystique of Slavic folklore with the whimsy of Irish fairy tales.\n\nAt the heart of this year's spectacle lies an enigmatic forest kingdom besieged by turmoil, where the inhabitants—be they the elusive Kikimora, the enigmatic Baba Yaga, the guardians of the woods known as Leshy, or the playful forest fairies—beckon you to partake in their world. As the narratives intertwine, you'll find yourself drawn deeper into a realm where magic reigns supreme and every shadow hides a secret waiting to be discovered.\n\nStep into the garden and become a part of a timeless saga where the boundaries between audience and performer dissolve, and where the collective imagination takes flight. \"Elemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\" promises an unforgettable odyssey where folklore and fairy tales converge, inviting you to embrace the magic that unites us all.\n\nElemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\n19:00 - 19:45\nSession 2\nElemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\n20:30 - 21:15",

Join our queens as they pay homage to their camp icons and queer favourites and meet a variety of very special guests from the worlds of burlesque, comedy and live music. With eighteen acts from across Ireland, expect a tour-de-force of sparkling sequins, camp comedy and non-stop nostalgia.\n\nBIO: Recently named one of Ireland's top tourist attractions by BBC One's The Travel Show, Mockie Ah! is Ireland's leading Drag Haus and queer performance collective. The legendary group was founded in 2017 by Irish drag artist Candy Warhol (Comedy Central's Dragony Aunts). The Cork City-based drag family has gone from strength to strength with regular nationwide cabarets, festival shows, club-nights and appearances across Europe. In 2019 the queens were featured on a Virgin Media pride special and in 2021 a critically acclaimed documentary focusing on five members of the group, Kin Of Kweens, was broadcast on RTÉ. In 2022 they hosted shows at Electric Picnic and Body and Soul and in 2023 they embarked on their first nationwide tours with Rupaul's Drag Race stars Le Fil and Just May and enjoyed a sold out run of their now annual Rocky Horror Picture Show. In 2024 they hosted Bambie Thug's Cork homecoming as part of their Cork Pride lineup and their new show, Mockie Ah's Camp Culture will mark the first of several shows at The Everyman.\n\nKeep an eye on social media for updates: https://www.instagram.com/mockieah/",

Through open studio sessions, workshops, talks, and cooking sessions, he aims to share his artistic journey and insights, fostering dialogues that intertwine the global narrative with the local tapestry.\n\nThe Whispering Sea exhibition continues until Friday 27th September.",

Curated by Sinéad Smyth.\n\nTwo artists gazing across a body of water, one island, two countries and an unclaimed border. The act of painting can often be negated in today' s modern art world. Indeed, there are many galleries which no longer exhibit paintings. The act of creating artwork has transmuted and transcended towards the philosophical, geographical, and humanistic elements of this and other multidimensional lines of inquiry. A fine endeavour and necessary evolution. However, when all of that, which can also be communicated through the gesture of painting, brings us to question and wonder, consider this exhibition as one to sit with and ponder your own perspectives, from your own shore.\n\nExhibition continues to 8th November and is available to view during building opening hours. Additional opening times may be possible on request.",

    "description": "Young people aged between 16 and 24, join illustrator and 2D animator, Nichola Irvine, on Friday 20th September from 7-9pm, for an evening of creative opportUNITY, activism, craic, personal and cultural exploration while exploring the process of DIY zine-making in the unique location of Atelier Hair in Ebrington Square!\n\nFor Culture Night 2024, young people aged 16-24 are invited to join illustrator and 2D animator, Nichola Irvine, on Friday 20th September from 7-9pm, for an evening of creative opportUNITY, activism, craic, personal and cultural exploration while exploring the process of DIY zine-making in the unique location of Atelier Hair in Ebrington Square!\nNichola Irvine, is a freelance Illustrator, 2d animator, painter, mural artist and teacher based in Belfast. Her work is a mix of traditional and digital and her aesthetic focuses on non-conventional canons of beauty; ugly art and colourful, quirky and often textural shapes.\nZines offer a wonderful medium for self-expression - whether you love keeping up with the latest fashion trends; are passionate about current affairs and politics; are an avid gamer; love sports; are a budding historian; or the next music journalist - zine-making is the perfect medium to express your thoughts and personal interests in a creative way! Zines can be super serious, or the silliest thing you have ever created - the options within the realm of zine-making are endless!\nDon't worry if you're new to zine-making or already a zine machine creator, Nichola will guide you through the process of sharing your passions in a collaborative group setting at your own pace. No experience is necessary, and all materials and refreshments will be provided but you are welcome to bring your own.\nIf you have any accessibility needs, please email fuseartsni@gmail.com ahead of the event and we will do our best to accommodate you.\n\nThis workshop is kindly funded by the Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of T:buc, The Northern Ireland Executive and Community Good Relations Council as part of Good Relations Week 2024 #GRW24",

The likes of Daniel O’Connell and James Stephens became housed here and the site also saw the execution of Joseph Poole in 1883. It housed hundreds of prisoners including some from the 1916 Easter Rising, became the Wellington Barracks in 1892 and was one of the first barracks turned over after Ireland gained independence.\n\nRenamed the Griffith Barracks, after Arthur Griffith in 1922 or 1923, it was eventually purchased to be utilised as a tertiary education institute in 1991 and today serves as home to Ireland’s largest independent third-level education provider.\n\nDiscover all of this and much more with a guided tour of the campus.",

Naturally, some of the paintings deal with incredibly tough topics. But there are also plenty of favourite hobbies, beloved pets and best friends - art that any child might create. This is perhaps what hits home the hardest.\n\nEach piece is accompanied by a statement from the artist, giving the most vulnerable, the most impacted and the most voiceless in this genocide an opportunity to be seen and heard.\n\nHeART of Gaza is a collaboration between friends, Feile Butler (Sligo) and Mohammed Timraz (Deir al Balah). Feile will be there on Culture Night to give the backstory to this life-changing project.\n\nLive music will be provided at the wine reception by local band, Killing Dove.\n\nThe exhibition will remain open to the public on 21-22 and 28-29 September. Over both weekends, visitors are invited to create art in response to HeART of Gaza. These messages of hope, empathy and solidarity will be sent back to Mohammed and the children in Gaza.",

Lots of medicines are made this way, using mammalian cells to produce a protein, such as an antibody that is actively therapeutic in humans. At NIBRT we have a training facility that has all of the elements of a biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant. Here we offer training to staff working in the industry and third-level university students. NIBRT is also a world-class research institute with a large team working to find solutions to challenges facing the biopharma industry.\n\nThis event will consist of a short introduction to NIBRT followed by a tour of the facility. Our scientists will be on hand to talk you through what we do at NIBRT. Please note that this event is suitable for ages 12+. For the tour of the facility, closed toe flat shoes and clothing that covers legs must be worn.",

    "description": "A dancer stands on the streets of Dublin with outstretched arms and a t-shirt that says “Dance With Me”. Will you accept their invitation?\n\nDancing With Strangers: From Palestine to Ireland is a guerrilla-style, durational, one-on-one participatory work. During the performances, Ireland-based dancers invite audiences to dance with them as they ‘stand in for’ four Palestinian dancers who are unable to be present.\n\nAs a choreographic act of resistance, Palestinian artists Agour, Just, Khaled and Maryam have been remote-working with Instant Dissidence’s Artistic Director, Rita Marcalo, to create dance duets that they would like to perform with the people of Ireland. As they are unable to be physically present in Ireland, this is achieved by members of the Irish dance community acting as ‘body avatars’ for the Palestinian dancer’s role in their respective duets.
