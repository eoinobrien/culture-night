    "description": "CULTURE NIGHT, FRIDAY 20th September 2024 at 8pm.\nThe Dominican 800th, Drogheda 1294-2024\nDrogheda's Musicians and Poets perform in a\nFREE CONCERT at the Augustinian Church, Shop St.\n''Poems, Bells and Synths''\nThe Augustinian Church in Shop St, possesses a unique Bell Tree of 40 chimes which is used during mass and rituals. The Bell Tree is tuned to C and G pentatonic scales. Michael Holohan, composer, will premiere a new work called Sounds from a Cloister using the bells to commemorate 800 years of the Dominican Order in Drogheda (1224-2024). The piece will be celebratory in nature and will acknowledge the great contribution of the Dominicans to the history of medieval Drogheda and not forgetting the huge contribution also made by The Augustinian and Franciscan orders. The composition will integrate the sounds of the other church bells of Drogheda i.e. the bells of St. Peter's Church of Ireland, St. Peter's Catholic Church and The Tholsel. The sounds of these bells will be recorded on tape and mixed with the live sounds in the church. This live performance will be accompanied by percussion. The audience will be surrounded with 'retro synthesiser sounds', percussion and bells thus giving our listeners a unique experience of 'spatial music.'\nThe performers will be Breifne Holohan, John Mc Crea, Grace Dillon, Trudy Maguire, Martin Shields, Joanne Kieran, Juliet Barrow, Barry Leahy, Stephen Higgins, Brendan Leahy and Michael Holohan, artistic director.\nSJ Mc Ardle, singer songwriter, will perform songs from his CD and song cycle Port.\nThe composer Breifne Holohan will perform pieces for electric guitar and electronics including Guth na Gaoithe, an improvisation featuring samples of Bronze age horns by Ancient Music Ireland.\nBetween the musical items readings will be given by the widely published Drogheda poets Susan Connolly, Roger Hudson, Emir Ní Daibhís, Paddy Dillon, John O'Rourke and Tomas De Faoite.\nWith the support of Create Louth and Culture Night\nAdmission: Free , no booking required. A wine reception will take place after the concert",

Dealing with the death of his younger brother, he is struggling to come to terms with all that he is, and everything that he’s not. Working as a customer support advisor in a call centre at a bin disposal company and experiencing many different escapades with his best friend Pauline, Malachy is eager to take some time to reflect on and move on with his life. He quickly comes to realise, however, that it’s not as easy as it seems on paper. A play about growing up, and the lessons we learn along the way.\n\nWritten & performed by Conor Burke, who received a nomination for the Micheál Mac Liammóir Award for Outstanding Lead Performance by an Actor in a Play at the 2023 International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival and directed by IFTA nominee Lesley Conroy.

To tackle the crisis, Herbert Simms was appointed the city’s first housing architect in the early 1930s. In a sixteen year period between 1932 and 1948, he and his Dublin Corporation team built an astounding 17,000 homes, some as inner city flat complexes and others as houses in newly-created suburbs such as Crumlin and Cabra.\n\nLike the city’s acclaimed Georgian squares, the Simms-designed Corporation flats in particular have stood the test of time, adding a touch of Art Deco and Modernist glamour to the inner city streets and, not before time, a number of them have been added to the city’s list of protected structures in recent year.\n\nIn this talk, St Mobhi's Parish take a look at Simms work and consider what can be learned from the 1930s approach to a severe urban housing crisis.",

The project examines the relationship between the islands of Ireland and their natural environment and puts our islands’ diverse communities, culture, and experiences right at the centre of the discourse surrounding our shared future.\n\nCurated by a team of five architects: Peter Carroll, Peter Cody, Elizabeth Hatz, Mary Laheen, and Joseph Mackey; Ireland’s national pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2023, In Search of Hy-Brasil, derives from an intense engagement with the islands of Ireland and is a direct provocation to all of us to reimagine the vast combined territory of land and ocean we call our home.\n\nWe are an island nation facing an uncertain future. The challenges of climate change, renewable energy, ethical food production and biodiversity must be met quickly, with purpose, renewing the lost equilibrium between ourselves and the natural world. In making this adjustment, our islands’ inventiveness in the face of adversity and creativity in response to having less provides us with the necessary tools and narratives to inspire more sustainable ways of living.\n\nJoin us on Culture Night 2024 for Island Celebrations! Follow @ArchAtTheEdge for updates.",

This year, artist Jialin Long has conceived the flag designs using the idea of the landmark as a witness, inspired by the Ha'penny Bridge in Dublin.\n\n‘Water symbolises the flow of people travelling from one place to another, while the bridge\nrepresents the connection between different cultures, fostering friendship and understanding. In my studio in Temple Bar, I am continually fascinated by the diverse crowd passing each day. The Ha'penny Bridge stands as a silent observer of the unique stories and backgrounds of every individual who crosses it.’\n\nThe flags can be seen flying over the Liffey on Wellington Quay for the month of September. There will be an accompanying drop-in workshop at Temple Bar Gallery + Studios on Culture Night.",

It also draws inspiration from the legend of Princess Beara, the Spanish Princess who it is said married Owen Mór, King of Ireland, around 120 AD and who gave the area its name.\n\nThe project has been showcased at the Irish Embassy UK, Dublin City Assembly House, London Irish Centre, Tuamgraney Harp Festival, Return to London Town Festival, the Wales International Harp Festival, Kenmare Buttermarket, Cornstown House and the World Harp Congress, Cardiff, generously supported by Culture Ireland. The album was recorded on location in Dawros Church, Co. Kerry by producer Laoise O' Brien and engineer Ben Rawlins and is funded by Kerry County Council Arts, Small Investments Ltd., the Wales International Harp Festival and Beara Distillery.\n\nA multiple prize winner, Tara has performed and recorded at venues including the Wigmore Hall, Abbey Road Studios, the National Concert Hall Dublin, Áras an Uachtaráin, St John's Smith Square, the Mansion House and the Irish Embassy in London.\n\nSeven times All-Ireland Champion, Robert released his critically acclaimed solo flute album Feochán in 2020. He has toured internationally with Dónal Lunny’s band Cíorras, the Traditional Arts Collective, The Katerina Garcia Band and The National Folk Orchestra of Ireland.\n\nFor any queries please contact westwicklowfestival@gmail.com.",

Roscommon by the County Leitrim Percy French Society.\n\nThe County Leitrim Percy French Society was formed by Tish Dunleavy and Frank Cadam as they realised that, despite his extensive musical repertoire French was under-appreciated and under-promoted. The society have performed in theatres all across the country, including two sell-out shows in the National Concert Hall, the show is performed by nine members of the Society in period costume with Frank Cadam taking the role of the great man himself, in a manner authentic to the spirit and arrangements in which French himself performed. From the moment the curtains rise the audience will be transported to a world of laughter, song and timeless story telling. The talented performers breathe life into Percy French's classic works with unparalleled passion and finesse. Their dedication to preserving Irish culture and heritage shines brightly in every note sung and every line delivered. The show is a delightful journey through the whimsical landscapes of Irish folklore and the tender moments of everyday life, all expertly woven together by the society's skilled actors and performers. From uproarious comedy to poignant ballads, each item is executed with precision and heart, eliciting a range of emotions from captivated audiences. The event will serve as a joyous celebration of the 170th anniversary of Percy French's birth.",

The students pride themselves on giving concerts from an early age in order to develop their technique and performance skills. In the group, all types of music are encouraged and Culture Night is a fantastic opportunity for them to show their enthusiasm and demonstration their interest in musical diversity. Come along to hear Bach's Double Violin concerto, Irish and European folk music, as well as a collaboration with Irish dancers for some reels and jigs. \n\nThe Suzuki philosophy is based on the mother tongue method, where parents are involved in the lesson by observing and working on the detail of the lesson with the child when practicing at home. Progress is not an accomplishment of big steps but rather, each small achievement is praised. Students are encouraged to do continuous workshops, concerts and graduations to motivate their practice. The ability to practice is not a natural effort but it is developed by praise and encouragement, mostly given at concerts. Some of the students you will hear have participated in workshops in Ireland and abroad and also have preformed in the Royal Albert Hall in London.",

The workshop will be a mix of hand and machine sewing, showing you how to be more sustainable with your textile items.

Geometric forms and underlying structures are frequent elements, but not to the exclusion of other organic shapes and mark making. Such approaches connect the work to visual art movements and music developments of the 20th century, but also to some of the oldest known paintings in human cultures around the world.",

This initiative unites a diverse group of young people from Galway City to address the challenges faced by their peers with physical disabilities.\n\nIn May 2023, a Youth Access Consultation was held to hear from young people with disabilities about their experiences in public and social spaces in Galway. Following this, funding from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) was secured to create this documentary.\n\nThe Youth Access Project aims to combat ableism and promote inclusivity. This documentary, crafted by young people, takes the audience on a journey with its participants, who share honest testimonies of living with a disability. Their personal stories highlight the barriers they encounter and the impact these obstacles have on their social interactions, raising awareness and advocating for more accessible environments.\n\nSince October 2023, these dedicated young filmmakers have worked tirelessly, conducting interviews and filming. Nova Productions is leading the project under the direction of award-winning filmmaker Teresa Lavina, ensuring a professional and impactful final product.\n\n'Breaking Barriers: Access for All' is a testament to the power of youth voices in driving social change. Join us in supporting accessibility and inclusivity for all young people.",

The album serves as both a celebration of Bianca's 14th anniversary as an immigrant in Ireland and a recognition of the rich tapestry of Irish and South American cultures.\nInspired by the notion that music can transport us through time, \"Time Machine\" is a captivating blend of ancient Irish influences, Brazilian roots, contemporary and various rhythms. Bianca's deep connection to her native South America infuses the album with tropical warmth while maintaining a delicate balance between Brazilian music, Irish music, folk, soul and jazz elements.\n\"This album is a labour of love, a tribute to the transformative power of music,\" says Bianca. \"It's a reflection of my journey as an immigrant and a celebration of the diverse music times that have shaped my identity.\"\nWith its unique blend of musical styles and heartfelt storytelling, \"Time Machine\" promises to be a standout debut from one of Ireland's most promising new talents. Don't miss your chance to experience Bianca's captivating musical journey – step into the \"Time Machine\" and let the music carry you away.",

This small child or doll’s garment is constructed from honeybees, wax, cotton and wire and reflects on themes associated with feminism, mythology and childhood.\n\nThis is a rare opportunity to view ‘Bee Dress’ on display for a limited time and hear from the artist herself about the materials, inspiration and processes involved in creating this thought-provoking artwork.\n\nFor further details, see - https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Country-Life/Events/2024/Q3-2024/Culture-Night-Oiche-Chultuir-2024",

    "description": "Opening of the exhibition 'Unreality' by artist Michaela McCann, at Alliance Française de Cork:\nMichaela McCann’s work explores absurdity and unreality through the medium of oil painting and photography. Through the use of techniques such as disjunction and displacement, Michaela conveys a sense of unreality in her work. The imagery in her work creates irrational and dream-like compositions, giving the work a sense of other-worldliness. Michaela takes inspiration from everyday life, often photographing objects or settings and taking them out of their usual contexts and then combining and juxtaposing them together in order to give the work a bizarre quality and provoke thought in the viewer. Through her work, Michaela aims to challenge social institutions by rejecting the logic and rationality of everyday life and instead embrace the nonsensical.",

Screening of an interview with members of Frybrook House will be exhibited on the night, to enhance the visual work on display. The house also supplied soup to the locals during the Great Famine (1845 to 1852), evidenced by a very large Famine Cauldron in the kitchen.\n\nThe gallery looks forward to exploring the Great Famine through various mediums.

This tradition not only embraces but celebrates the arts, integrating them into the very fabric of Buddhist practice as well as the vibrant culture of the Dublin Buddhist Centre.\n\nThrough Buddhist practice, the worlds of myth, imagination, and archetype come alive. For many people, this can produce a profound encounter with the transcendental.\n\nThere will be a reception with light refreshments as well as an introduction by Prasannadeva in conversation with some of the artists showcased.",

Distillation is a response to the recent cessation of the peat harvesting industry in Ireland.\n\nOver the past year, Luke Casserly has collaborated with renowned perfume maker Joan Woods to create a unique distillation of the Midlands bog – the place where he grew up – as the starting point for an olfactory encounter which looks at our human relationship to place. Dedicated to the future of our broken landscapes – in the hope that by listening to them, we might be able to better understand them.\n\nPart lecture, part performance, the project is an ambitious attempt to look at our human relationship to landscape through scent. As an artist from the Irish Midlands, Luke was inspired to make the piece in response to the recent cessation of the peat harvesting industry, as a way of stretching out further conversations around the environmental potential of the Irish bog landscape.\n\nLuke has collaborated with renowned perfume maker Joan Woods over the past year to create a unique distillation of the Irish bog, the starting point for an olfactory performance which attempts to translate the landscape for a live audience in an intimate and inventive way. Each audience member will be invited to smell the custom-made perfume as part of the performance.\n\nSupported by Goethe-Institut Irland, with additional development support by IMMA, Druid FUEL, NTE and Backstage Theatre’s Activate Residency programme.",

Contemporary dance is an expressive style that combines elements of several dance genres including modern, Jazz, Lyrical and Classical Ballet. BOLD will also feature two duets.",

Maireann a cháil sa tseanchas i measc an phobail agus i measc muintir Shuibhne atá fós breá bríomhar in iarthar Chonamara. Scríobh an staraí Hardiman faoi sa mbliain 1846 agus bhailigh Tomás Ó Máille a chuid amhráin ón bpobal don leabhar Micheál Mac Suibhne agus Filidh an tSléibhe i 1934. Tiocfaidh aisteoirí, fonnadóirí agus gaolta leis an tSuibhneach le chéile lena shaol agus a shaothar a cheiliúradh. Páirteach beidh Cumann Dramaíochta Chorr na Móna, Máirín Uí Chéide, Orla Ní Fhinneadha, Seán O Coistealbha, Colm Seoighe agus Micheál O Gionnáin.

While entertaining it also preserves the oral traditions that form an integral part of Ireland, stories often passed through generation with a unique local identity.\n\nMoving outdoors to Back Lane we have planned a lively session of traditional Irish music featuring local practitioners. This session will feature the haunting melodies of fiddles, tin whistles, bodhráns and accordions. This spontaneous expression of Irish music will breathe life into the very air, captivating the community and creating intimate connections between musicians and listeners.\n\nFollowing the session we return inside for Sean Nòs, an unaccompanied vocal style of singing deeply rooted in Irish Tradition. Known for its intricate ornamentation and free rhythm, Sean Nòs singing conveys profound emotion and narrative through its unique delivery.\n\nTraditional Story Telling\n9:00pm - 9:30pm\n\nTraditional Irish Music Session\n10:00pm - 11:30pm\n\nSean Nos\n11:45pm - 12:15am",

With a reputation for pushing the boundaries of sound, their setup will transform the plaza into a high-energy haven that is true to the roots of soundsystem culture.\n\nt-woc is an Irish producer & DJ known for blending genres, both in his own productions and his DJ sets.

She is the founder of foxgluv and was a participant in the Skin & Blister DJ workshops. Her style combines a mix of bass-heavy genres such as afro/caribbean inspired riddims, UKg, breaks, grime, drums, baile funk, and more.\n\nIn addition to his hard-won mad-skills behind the decks, Jonezy’s vast horde of ridiculous records is as fine an anthology as any in Ireland. Soulful reggae classics, hidden jungle gems, the latest Manchester hybrid halftime weapon – Jonezy mashes the dance and puts it back together with ease. In 2010, Jonezy launched his own promotion concept, Riseup! to explore a broader take on modern rave sounds and bring key, cutting edge acts to Cork. With his dad, a trained chippy, Jonezy built The RiseUp!

    "description": "Goodcellas is a friendly ensemble of members of the cello section of Cork Fleischmann Symphony Orchestra, playing music from their wide repertoire. Goodcellas will run from 7-7.40pm.\nA uniquely fascinating aural journey through the Irish 20th century, in collaboration with IndieCork Film Festival will take place from 8-9.30pm. Selecting from his vinyl archive of rare 20th century Irish Classical Music, music expert John Byrne is our insightful and encyclopedic guide. John writes, I would lay claim for the beginning of the Irish 20th century as being in 1936, the year that a young gay Irish composer called Frederick May found himself fleeing Austria and the spreading tentacles of Fascism. His reaction was the penning of his 'String Quartet In C Minor'. The creation of indigenous Classical composition went very literally technicolor with the scribing of this piece. But no-one noticed at the time. Why? The answer comes down to intentional state policy. The music went unsupported by state decree. Things slowly changed in the latter decades of the last century with the appearance of Irish Classical performers and composition on records. And thus the proper beginning of our aural story. This presentation will give you the emergence of a genre of music in recorded form. Accompanying visuals by IndieCork's Tony Langlois.\n\nMusic - Cork Cello Collective plus Vinyl Archive",

The name captures perfectly humanity’s place in space and time in the vastness of the universe and the delicate nature of our important relationship with our planet.\n\nThere will be five shows across the evening and screenings will be of approximately 20 minutes duration. Each show will be filled on a first come, first served basis with plenty of other activities to do during the evening. Ballycroy Women’s Group will present World Food Night concurrently at the Community Centre, providing food and hospitality prepared especially for the evening. All are welcome.\n\nFor Culture Night, an especially designed \"Star Trail\" will also be available to experience and it will guide visitors to enjoy ample stargazing (weather dependent), biodiversity and indoor activities, as well as a dark skywalk, adjacent to the visitor centre of the National Park. At the Wild Nephin National Park Visitor Centre Special Astronomy introductions, both English and As Gaeilge will be screened on repeat adjacent to indoor astronomy activities, while at the Outdoor Classroom, will be the Under One Sky multi-sensory experience with sensory trail, telescopes and observation. For the late night owls, there will be a Dark Sky/ Stargazing Walk at 10.30pm, which will be a looped walk of approx. 1.5km (weather permitting).",

    "description": "6aside is a photography series capturing in-game, first-person point of view action from Cork's community and street league football tournament.\n\nEach week, a different player from one of the participating teams wears a body-mounted camera while playing in a different position, capturing their personal in-game experience. The resulting series tells a cohesive story of often-overlooked moments in small-sided football, while emphasising the power of football to unite diverse communities in a rapidly changing Ireland.\n\nThis year-round event takes place in The Glen, Cork city, and features players from various social and marginalised backgrounds, including those in supported accommodation, individuals at risk of or formerly experiencing homelessness, recovering addicts, residents from two international accommodation centres, former residents who have gained residency, Travelers, members of Cork's Polish, Italian, and Spanish communities, unemployed young men from the city's northside, members of the LGBTI community, support workers, journalists, and more.\n\nThe idea of passing the camera to different players was inspired by Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama’s concept of “photography by feel.” Moriyama, known for shooting without using the viewfinder, captures images based on instinct and emotion. Series curator and photographer Paul Carroll adopted this concept, entrusting his camera to a different player each week. Moreover, he involved the players in the editing and selection process.\n\nThe resulting work is a participant-driven, serendipitous blend of sport and street photography, offering a portrait of both the struggles and joys of the game as the seasons pass. It celebrates Ireland’s dynamic, vibrant, and evolving landscape while dramatizing the power of community through sport.\n\nThe Culture Night 2024 one-night installation of 6aside pays homage to Carroll's teenage obsession with football in a culturally homogeneous 1990's Ireland. Instead of posters of star footballers on his bedroom wall, this exhibition showcases members of Cork's Community and street Leagues. It encapsulates an open, multicultural, and inclusive Ireland, underscoring how sport often leads the way in reflecting societal change.\n\nExhibition space: A fully interactive experience featuring a foosball table for visitors to enjoy, along with a computer setup and gamepads for playing the classic video game Sensible Soccer.",

Known for their vibrant and positive energy, the group have performed on stage with Damien Rice at Cork Opera House and with Eimear Crehan at the Marina Market Cork.\n\nReadings from Cork stories - 18:45 to 19:15\nA reading from Cork Stories (Doire Press, 2024), an anthology of short fiction set in various locations in Cork City and County Cork, by writers who live or have lived in Cork.\n\nELLES MITRAILLENT EXHIBITION - 17:00 to 20:30\nThe aim of our project is to give a voice to women photographers so that they can free their artistic expression and, through their photographs, convey the changes that have affected their lives and share the everyday moments and decisive experiences of recent years.Our trademark is to have our photos printed on large curtains, the works exude lightness and fluidity, marking the spirit and enriching the visitor's experience. Visitors always love to “get into the photographs”.\n\nIrene Kelleher Performance - 19:30 to 20:00\nFootnote is a one-woman comedy, told from the point of view of Noreen Gilhooly, a long struggling writer who works in her local bookshop for the past ten years ago. Noreen dreams of emulating the success of her mother, the famous poet, author and feminist-activist Genevieve de Lacy. Living in her mother’s shadow hasn’t been easy, from ex-boyfriends reciting her mother’s poetry in the bedroom to customers educating her on who her mother ‘really’ was. But Noreen isn’t her mother, more into dismantling a ‘World-Book Day’ stand than the patriarchy, her only edge is refusing to floss her teeth and her greatest talent might be alphabetising the children’s section. But with the promise of a publication finally pending Noreen has to decide, is she ready to take her place amongst the literary greats or remain her mother’s footnote.\n\nJimmy Crowley and Eve Telford; an evening of music - 20:00 to 20:45\nCome along and hear Eve Telford and Jimmy Crowley sing a selection of our Cork favorites and some Ceol and Lore is guaranteed , we are looking forward to what is guaranteed to be a great event.\n\nHarp, voice and flute performance - 16:00 to 16:45\nNancy and Miriam Long of Ceolann, are a talented, versatile harp, voice and flute duo, who enthrall and delight audiences throughout West Cork and Munster.Nancy is the musical director of both the Skibbereen Cathedral Choir and Enchant Choral Group.She is an accomplished harpist, organist and vocalist.",

    "description": "Scéalaíocht agus Ceol le Julie Ann De Brún 6.00-7.00 followed by a Literary panel discussion featuring renowned Poet Emily Cullen and Authors Elizabeth Reapy and Edel Coffey.\n\nEmily Cullen is a remarkable poet who has contributed to various commemorative projects. One of her poems, “Roller Skating in Kilmainham,” reflects on the life of Grace Gifford Plunkett, who married Joseph Plunkett in Kilmainham Gaol during the tumultuous period of Irish history. The poem captures the emotions and struggles of that time. Her third poetry collection, “Conditional Perfect” (2019), received acclaim and was included in The Irish Times’ roundup of the best new poetry of that year. Elizabeth Reapy is known for her novels, including “Red Dirt” (2016) and “Skin” (2019). These works explore themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth. “Red Dirt” is set in Australia and follows the lives of three Irish friends who emigrate there. It delves into their struggles, dreams, and the challenges they face in a foreign land. “Skin” is a powerful novel that examines the complexities of mental health and self-discovery. Edel Coffey’s novel “Breaking Point” (2022) garnered much attention. It’s a gripping suspense story that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. Her second novel, “In Her Place” (2024), is set in New York and revolves around Ann, who becomes entangled in a complicated relationship after her mother’s death. When Ann meets Justin, a grieving man whose wife is still alive but gravely ill, their lives take unexpected turns.\n\nThe novel explores love, loss, and the choices we make when faced with difficult circumstances. These authors have contributed significantly to contemporary Irish literature, and their works offer diverse perspectives and engaging storytelling.\n\nThis event is a panel discussion and will be chaired by Emily Cullen.",

Join our expert guides for an engaging tour of the Casino, where you will discover the incredible design and history of this hidden gem.\n\nGuided tours will take place at 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm, and 7 pm during Culture Night.\n\nTickets for the tours are free but must be booked in advance through Eventbrite",

Semple also designed churches at Whitechurch, Kilternan, Tallaght, St Mary’s Chapel of Ease (Black Church), Abbeyleix and Killeshin. When the church opened on Christmas Day 1831, the Dublin Penny Journal claimed that \"There was not a spot in the church where the eye can rest without pain\"!\n\n100 years later, Sir John Betjeman described it as ‘a cheerful Irish castle with a seaside rather than a fortress flavour’.\n\nWe invite you to come and visit the church and decide for yourself whether the above descriptions adequately describe this extraordinary building. The church is partially wheelchair accessible. Free guide leaflets, quizzes for adults and treasure hunts and quizzes for children will be available.",

A Record of Tenderness by Richard Malone is a powerful exploration of labour and class through sculpture, performance, film and a site-specific mural at The Dock. CREATION by Deborah Kelly unfurls across generations, identities, artforms and places, and changes with each iteration, acquiring songs, congregants, iconography, poems, recipes, rules. Both artists celebrate the queer imagination.\n\nHow Can One Not Love You 2.0\nIconic short films from Ukraine\nPerformance Space, 7pm\n\nHow Can One Not Love You 2.0 is a selection of iconic short films about Kyiv.

    "description": "Elaine Quinlan – Exhibition Launch, 4-7pm\n\nThe Leitrim Design House is delighted to showcase a new exhibition Elaine Quinlan, an Irish artist living and working in rural Galway.\n\nShe paints in her studio in an area known for its marshy lowlands, rocky limestone fields and turloughs. These turloughs or vanishing lakes are the inspiration for her work, which lies somewhere between abstraction and representation. Pools, reflections, straggly grasses and mossy lichens are regular motifs in her paintings.\n\nWorking in either oils or acrylics, she builds up layers of paint with lots of glazing and delicate mark-making to create colourful, ethereal paintings on wood panels and canvas.\n\nLiving close to the Burren has also inspired her to create smaller works exploring a more graphic style - little snapshots of the colours and shapes she sees in the landscape there.\n\nDrop-in Workshop Scarf Puppets with Rose Minnema, 4-7pm\n\nRose Minnema is a puppet builder and facilitates workshops to create puppets and manipulating them. Puppetry is a beautiful medium to express oneself and explore themes such as biodiversity, racial diversity and one's identity in a safe and playful way. Respect, compassion, joy and a sense of wonder about life are key elements in my work and I like to transmit that during the workshops by stimulating participants to get actively involved and use their imagination.\n\nDuring this drop-in workshop in The Leitrim Design House Rose will make a selection of medium size scarf puppets. Participants will first assemble the puppets and afterwards there will be a possibility the play with them. This will give the participants a great opportunity to see something of the process of making puppets and get a sense of manipulating them. All ages are welcome to join this exciting interactive workshop.",

The film is one component part of the multidisciplinary event of the same name, which also incorporates performance, music, song, painting and poetry. It took place at The New Theatre in Dublin last March opening on Luxemburgs birthday (5th March) and ran for 3 nights. It is a collaboration between Douglas Henderson - composer, singer/songwriter, musician, performer and translator and Noël O’Callaghan - visual artist, performer, singer/musician and text writer.\nInspired by the poem ‘du liegst/you lie’ from German-Jewish poet Paul Celan, music, painting and poetry creates a lyrical homage to Luxemburg and her message of anti-militarism. This was filmed along the Landwehr Canal in Berlin where Rosa's body was thrown following her murder at the hand of the far-right Freicorps. White Feathers collected from the Berlin canal swans symbolise the struggle for peace during WWI. Juxtaposed with Emmeline Pankhurst’s White Feather Campaign, they transform this erstwhile badge of shame into a symbol of defiance and peace in Rosa's name.\nA selection of paintings from the Feathers for Rosa exhibition will also be displayed and the artists will be present to answer questions on Luxemburg, Paul Celan and their life in Berlin before and after the fall of the wall.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thesketchoftheday/\n\nStudio 3: Mark Beatty\n‘Using a map, projector and Google Maps Street View I offer participants the chance to travel on The 'Purple' Road and see West Cork in a new light.’\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thepurpleroad/",

    "description": "Last year we successfully produced a short ﬁlm and held a screening for Culture Night, 'Our Treasure, The Curragh of Kildare'. This achievement motivated us to apply for the Heritage Keepers course for 2024, which we completed with the Burren Beo trust of the Heritage Council. As part of our “actions” we are producing a podcast series, one of the course outcomes. For Culture night 2024 we plan to host Curragh Chronicles, Uisce Domhain Curragh Heritage Keepers; discussion and digital exhibition and record the discussions as an episode.\n\nThis podcast series along with other projects we have undertaken as Heritage Keepers will be published on our developing website. We will be recording the series in many places and spaces all centred around the Curragh, including some “ﬁreside chats” in the Croft Inn to chronicle The Curragh.\n\nThis podcast episode, Curragh Culture Night, will cover various aspects of the Curragh of Kildare including cultural, environmental, natural and built heritage, surrounding the it. We will host an open panel discussion, recording the session for publication. Additionally we will issue an open call for a digital exhibition to be held in conjunction with the event, inviting creatives of all kinds and ages to share their work inspired by Curragh of Kildare. The many works will be presented in the venue including imagery connected to our Heritage Keeping through digital screens and projections.",

It was within reggae dance culture he met Salim, an Irish-Malaysian producer and composer.\n\nA collaboration was formed and the mighty Damai Sound was born. In the mix, bringing the mic to life is Aminah whose own soulful free-style jam complements this roots experience.

The current exhibition Possible Life is a series of large ‘punk zen’ Indian brush drawings on water colour paper by artist Chris Doris.\n\nThese large circular works of art are ambiguous, alluding to cellular and planetary cosmic fields of becoming. The images are informed by the artist’s long experience as a meditator and psychotherapist in Western and Buddhist psychology. The works rest on the contemplative seeing of somatic and cosmic fields – macro and micro.",

Directed and choreographed by David Bolger, this show unites two of Ireland's most exciting performers, Stephanie Dufresne and Alex O’Neill for the very first time – in an intimate duet that grooves between hope and the dystopia of an angry world.\n\nIt's 2024 and the witching hour. As dusk approaches, the doors of the hall are flung wide open. You are invited to enter. Two enigmatic dancers hit the dance floor – quietly questioning their hopes and dreams amongst the surrounding turmoil. As their shadows deepen, they take more chances and dance more dances – “where are we headed to, where does it all end?”",

How can one emulate Whitman and \"\"sing oneself\"\", when speaking out is dangerous?\n\nThis theatrical adaptation of the poetry of local poet Denise Garvey combines poetic text with live performance & musicianship to innovate new ways of delivering literary work. It is\na preview of a longer piece currently in development, and explores themes of belonging, patriarchy, difference, striving, and the fertile place where language, music and embodiment intersect.\n\nAs a theatre director, Sarah O'Toole enjoys working with ensemble performers to find unique ways of staging poetry. Thanks to an Arts Council Agility Award, she and four actor-musicians spent a weekend earlier this year exploring performance approaches to Denise's work, and we are very looking forward to giving audiences a taste of our explorations upstairs at The Mick Lally Theatre at 8pm on Culture Night.\n\nWe are very grateful to Galway City Council & The Mick Lally Theatre & Kumon City West for their support in delivering this exciting cross-disciplinary event.",

Tá Rónán Ó Conghaile i mbun damhsa sean-nós le roinnt blianta anuas, d’éirigh leis Comórtas Steip a bhaint amach ag Oireachtais na Samhna. Chomh maith le sin, bíonn Rónán ag casadh amhráin sean-nóis, tá sé ag obair ar a seacht ndícheall leis an traidisiún a choinneáil beo beathach don chéad ghlúin eile. Tá mise ag casadh amhráin ó bhí mé an-óg, tá an traidisiún tagtha anuas tríd glúnta na gCeannabháin uilig ó Mháire Ghabha & Michael Mháire Ghabha. Tá mé féin, Mick Connelly agus David Munnelly ag ceol lena chéile le bliain anuas. Rinne muid camchuairt bheag timpeall na hÉireann agus Stiúideo Cuan ina measc. Bheadh muid lán sásta an maoiniú a fháil ionas go dtig linn leanúint ar aghaidh ag ardú spiorad agus croíthe an pobal go léir.",

The workshop aims to highlight and generate discussion on town-wide accessibility issues, starting at the front steps of Kunstverein Aughrim. Participants will assemble and test a temporary access ramp in the form of a drawbridge that can be inserted into a building's threshold. As part of the workshop, Kunstverein Aughrim and Howff will present their learning following a year-long Accessibility Study of Aughrim (titled Suppose a Stone) that encompassed a series of surveys and activity maps, a Sensory Walk, and a Walkability Study. Suppose a Stone was a collaboration between Aughrim Tidy Towns CLG, Aughrim Active Retirement Group, Kunstverein Aughrim and Howff Architects, supported by the Irish Architecture Foundation’s Reimagine Hometown Architect initiative. Findings will be shared for future learning.\n\nThis workshop takes place from 2-5 pm.\n\nBooking will be available via Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/1002312843697?aff=oddtdtcreator\n\nFor any queries please see https://kunstverein.ie/Drawbridge-Workshop\n\nBooking Email Address: office@kunstverein.ie",

It is the presence of justice\nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThis is a dance event/workshop led by Bernadette Divilly, dance movement artist who specialises in socially-engaged practices centred on the body-mind relationship.\n\nThis event involves audience engagement and participation in investigating the conditions essential for the presence of peace. It includes somatic explorations, improvisational dance scores and deep listening. We will contemplate what it means to do no harm. We will explore breathable boundaries, power, language differences and cultural conditions.\n\nAudience engagement is central and participatory every step of the way, focusing on connection between the human nervous system and co-creating through movement. We will investigate how an exploration of knowing justice is essential to our health, wellbeing and survival while honouring that we are all interconnected.\n\nSome parts of the event will be documented and shared digitally.\n\nSupported by Galway Dance",

This immersive promenade performance unveils four spellbinding narratives, each unfolding in distinct corners of the garden, marrying the mystique of Slavic folklore with the whimsy of Irish fairy tales.\n\nAt the heart of this year's spectacle lies an enigmatic forest kingdom besieged by turmoil, where the inhabitants—be they the elusive Kikimora, the enigmatic Baba Yaga, the guardians of the woods known as Leshy, or the playful forest fairies—beckon you to partake in their world. As the narratives intertwine, you'll find yourself drawn deeper into a realm where magic reigns supreme and every shadow hides a secret waiting to be discovered.\n\nStep into the garden and become a part of a timeless saga where the boundaries between audience and performer dissolve, and where the collective imagination takes flight. \"Elemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\" promises an unforgettable odyssey where folklore and fairy tales converge, inviting you to embrace the magic that unites us all.\n\nElemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\n19:00 - 19:45\nSession 2\nElemental Tales 3 - Enchanted Garden\n20:30 - 21:15",

Join our queens as they pay homage to their camp icons and queer favourites and meet a variety of very special guests from the worlds of burlesque, comedy and live music. With eighteen acts from across Ireland, expect a tour-de-force of sparkling sequins, camp comedy and non-stop nostalgia.\n\nBIO: Recently named one of Ireland's top tourist attractions by BBC One's The Travel Show, Mockie Ah! is Ireland's leading Drag Haus and queer performance collective. The legendary group was founded in 2017 by Irish drag artist Candy Warhol (Comedy Central's Dragony Aunts). The Cork City-based drag family has gone from strength to strength with regular nationwide cabarets, festival shows, club-nights and appearances across Europe. In 2019 the queens were featured on a Virgin Media pride special and in 2021 a critically acclaimed documentary focusing on five members of the group, Kin Of Kweens, was broadcast on RTÉ. In 2022 they hosted shows at Electric Picnic and Body and Soul and in 2023 they embarked on their first nationwide tours with Rupaul's Drag Race stars Le Fil and Just May and enjoyed a sold out run of their now annual Rocky Horror Picture Show. In 2024 they hosted Bambie Thug's Cork homecoming as part of their Cork Pride lineup and their new show, Mockie Ah's Camp Culture will mark the first of several shows at The Everyman.\n\nKeep an eye on social media for updates: https://www.instagram.com/mockieah/",

Through open studio sessions, workshops, talks, and cooking sessions, he aims to share his artistic journey and insights, fostering dialogues that intertwine the global narrative with the local tapestry.\n\nThe Whispering Sea exhibition continues until Friday 27th September.",

Curated by Sinéad Smyth.\n\nTwo artists gazing across a body of water, one island, two countries and an unclaimed border. The act of painting can often be negated in today' s modern art world. Indeed, there are many galleries which no longer exhibit paintings. The act of creating artwork has transmuted and transcended towards the philosophical, geographical, and humanistic elements of this and other multidimensional lines of inquiry. A fine endeavour and necessary evolution. However, when all of that, which can also be communicated through the gesture of painting, brings us to question and wonder, consider this exhibition as one to sit with and ponder your own perspectives, from your own shore.\n\nExhibition continues to 8th November and is available to view during building opening hours. Additional opening times may be possible on request.",

    "description": "Young people aged between 16 and 24, join illustrator and 2D animator, Nichola Irvine, on Friday 20th September from 7-9pm, for an evening of creative opportUNITY, activism, craic, personal and cultural exploration while exploring the process of DIY zine-making in the unique location of Atelier Hair in Ebrington Square!\n\nFor Culture Night 2024, young people aged 16-24 are invited to join illustrator and 2D animator, Nichola Irvine, on Friday 20th September from 7-9pm, for an evening of creative opportUNITY, activism, craic, personal and cultural exploration while exploring the process of DIY zine-making in the unique location of Atelier Hair in Ebrington Square!\nNichola Irvine, is a freelance Illustrator, 2d animator, painter, mural artist and teacher based in Belfast. Her work is a mix of traditional and digital and her aesthetic focuses on non-conventional canons of beauty; ugly art and colourful, quirky and often textural shapes.\nZines offer a wonderful medium for self-expression - whether you love keeping up with the latest fashion trends; are passionate about current affairs and politics; are an avid gamer; love sports; are a budding historian; or the next music journalist - zine-making is the perfect medium to express your thoughts and personal interests in a creative way! Zines can be super serious, or the silliest thing you have ever created - the options within the realm of zine-making are endless!\nDon't worry if you're new to zine-making or already a zine machine creator, Nichola will guide you through the process of sharing your passions in a collaborative group setting at your own pace. No experience is necessary, and all materials and refreshments will be provided but you are welcome to bring your own.\nIf you have any accessibility needs, please email fuseartsni@gmail.com ahead of the event and we will do our best to accommodate you.\n\nThis workshop is kindly funded by the Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of T:buc, The Northern Ireland Executive and Community Good Relations Council as part of Good Relations Week 2024 #GRW24",

The likes of Daniel O’Connell and James Stephens became housed here and the site also saw the execution of Joseph Poole in 1883. It housed hundreds of prisoners including some from the 1916 Easter Rising, became the Wellington Barracks in 1892 and was one of the first barracks turned over after Ireland gained independence.\n\nRenamed the Griffith Barracks, after Arthur Griffith in 1922 or 1923, it was eventually purchased to be utilised as a tertiary education institute in 1991 and today serves as home to Ireland’s largest independent third-level education provider.\n\nDiscover all of this and much more with a guided tour of the campus.",

Naturally, some of the paintings deal with incredibly tough topics. But there are also plenty of favourite hobbies, beloved pets and best friends - art that any child might create. This is perhaps what hits home the hardest.\n\nEach piece is accompanied by a statement from the artist, giving the most vulnerable, the most impacted and the most voiceless in this genocide an opportunity to be seen and heard.\n\nHeART of Gaza is a collaboration between friends, Feile Butler (Sligo) and Mohammed Timraz (Deir al Balah). Feile will be there on Culture Night to give the backstory to this life-changing project.\n\nLive music will be provided at the wine reception by local band, Killing Dove.\n\nThe exhibition will remain open to the public on 21-22 and 28-29 September. Over both weekends, visitors are invited to create art in response to HeART of Gaza. These messages of hope, empathy and solidarity will be sent back to Mohammed and the children in Gaza.",

Lots of medicines are made this way, using mammalian cells to produce a protein, such as an antibody that is actively therapeutic in humans. At NIBRT we have a training facility that has all of the elements of a biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant. Here we offer training to staff working in the industry and third-level university students. NIBRT is also a world-class research institute with a large team working to find solutions to challenges facing the biopharma industry.\n\nThis event will consist of a short introduction to NIBRT followed by a tour of the facility. Our scientists will be on hand to talk you through what we do at NIBRT. Please note that this event is suitable for ages 12+. For the tour of the facility, closed toe flat shoes and clothing that covers legs must be worn.",

    "description": "A dancer stands on the streets of Dublin with outstretched arms and a t-shirt that says “Dance With Me”. Will you accept their invitation?\n\nDancing With Strangers: From Palestine to Ireland is a guerrilla-style, durational, one-on-one participatory work. During the performances, Ireland-based dancers invite audiences to dance with them as they ‘stand in for’ four Palestinian dancers who are unable to be present.\n\nAs a choreographic act of resistance, Palestinian artists Agour, Just, Khaled and Maryam have been remote-working with Instant Dissidence’s Artistic Director, Rita Marcalo, to create dance duets that they would like to perform with the people of Ireland. As they are unable to be physically present in Ireland, this is achieved by members of the Irish dance community acting as ‘body avatars’ for the Palestinian dancer’s role in their respective duets.

    "description": "Dublin Leather Store is a supplier of leather and leather-work tools and accessories. As well as being a store, it is also a workshop where leather goods are manufactured and it runs classes teaching people the basics of leather working.\n\nFor Culture Night, Dublin Leather Store are offering a short workshop, introducing some of the tools and techniques involved in leather work. The workshop will look at the techniques used in dyeing and sewing small leather goods and will teach some of the basics that are needed to take up leather crafting as a hobby. At the end of the class, attendees will be able to go away with the small project that has been completed on the evening of the event.\n\nThis is the first of two workshops taking place on Culture Night, and will repeat at 20:00. It is important to note that there will be dyes used in the workshop so it’s a good idea to come prepared and wear clothes you don’t mind potentially getting stained. Not suitable for children under 14.\n\nThis event is now fully booked, however walk-ins may be admitted if capacity allows.",

    "description": "This introductory workshop with local artist Terry Lawless will introduce participants to the basic skill of relief printmaking. The participants will have the chance to make their own one-colour design that they will transfer onto a lino block, carve out, ink up and print.\n\nWe will look at a brief history of lino printing and how it has impacted on the areas of craft, graphic arts as well as fine arts. How print is currently enjoying a revival and where you can see it.\n\nThe participants will be introduced to the process of developing a design. We will look at composing a simple design, exploring the art elements of line and tone and the design principles of contract and balance. In using these the students will develop a simple design that can be transferred to the block.\n\nThe participants will then learn the skills needed for inking up blocks and testing different techniques to roll out inks. They will then have time to print their design onto a variety of surfaces, including different types of papers as well as fabrics.\n\nAll students will go home with several prints made from their designs.\nAll tools, inks, rollers, cutting tools, pencils, and papers will be supplied.\nThere is no need to be able to draw! Terry has plenty of ways around this!!\nBring a simple A5 (Half A4) image that you would like to make into a design, If you don’t have one or forget, Terry will supply one.\n\nPlease book by contacting Loretta in the library at Lrose@wicklowcoco.ie or calling 0404-67025",

Dialogue between the two dates back over fifteen years around their common passion for material and form. Here at the CCI, in a poetic interweaving of expression, twelve unique sculptural Enignum Wall Brackets hold twelve porcelain vessels and a landscape of vessels spread across the burr ash surface of an Enignum Dining Table. Together, these organic sculptures and ceramics are contextualised and create an uplifting ensemble of infinite delicacy.\n\nTo coincide with Culture Night, the Centre Culturel Irlandais will be holding the exhibition opening on Friday 20 September. There will be a food truck onsite in the courtyard, plus music by Irene and Linda Buckley from 8pm.",

Using historically accurate designs and up-cycled materials Grace hand stitches costumes for theatre, and re-enactments. For Culture Night, Grace will present samples of her work and will explain the process of making them. You may even get a chance to dress up in an outfit originally designed hundreds of years ago!\n\nPaper conservator and artist Olena Kovalevych, along with some of our volunteer team has been putting together an exhibition of paintings, based on the Historic Walled Gardens at the Park. Olena is a master of the petrykivka painting style. There will be a drop-in workshop where participants will learn some of the basics of this traditional painting style, which has been listed on the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural heritage of Humanity.\nBoth Grace’s and Olena’s workshops are perfect for all ages.\n\nFim maker Padraig Cunningham and sound artist Natalia Beylis have collaborated on a short film inspired by the work of the curator and volunteers here at Strokestown Park House, as they sort through a collection of recently re-discovered artefacts. This film which has been inspired by the idea that objects have their own history and story, will be shown for the first time on Culture Night. This film has been kindly supported by Creative Ireland through Roscommon County Council Arts Office.\nCurator, archivist and musician Martin Fagan returns to Strokestown Park House, bringing his band Stalked by Story to perform in the historic surroundings of the Vaulted Stables. Hailing from Westmeath, Stalked by Story are building up a steady following throughout the mid-lands and will bring their Gothic folk tales of souls from times long past, rural heroes and heroines to the good people of Strokestown.\nBe prepared to be amazed by sound artist Natalia Beylis who will perform original work inspired by her time spent at Strokestown House this year. Natalia’s' art revolves somewhere between sonic story-teller and multi-instrumental explorer. She has released 35 albums between solo works and collaborations and has appeared on numerous compilation releases.\nWe are thrilled to have such a high calibre of artists with us for Culture Night and we hope that you can come along to experience this wonderful initiative with us.",

Playing with the viewer's imagination and wit, the compositions are intentionally absurd and thoroughly enthralling, drawing the eye and mind into his world. McSherry’s pieces have been exhibited in galleries in London, Paris, Dublin and elsewhere, and he teaches art classes and runs painting retreats.\n\nÉigse Terenure is a local community group interested in promoting arts and culture events in the area.",

Ireland entered the Olympics in 1924 a year and half after the Free State had been declared. Jack B Yeats’ Silver medal for ‘The Liffey Swim’ (1923) painting, and Oliver St John Gogarty’s Bronze for his ‘Ode to the Tailteann Games’ were the first Olympic Medals won for Ireland as a free nation.\n\nBut what does it mean to compete as an artist? What does it mean to represent your nation alongside, and against, others? Who decides the difference between gold, silver and bronze levels of creativity – and does it matter?\n\nArtists included are Jack B. Yeats, Letitia Hamilton, Seán Keating, Mainie Jellett, Fr. Jack P. Hanlon, Desmond Broe, Flora Vere O’Brien, Ina Boyle, Stella Steyn, Hilda Roberts, Sir John Lavery, Sir William Orpen and more.\n\nAs part of the Creative Ireland funded ‘Muscles & Mind: Open-Call’, the gallery is also to present a group exhibition exploring themes of nationality, representation, and art as competition, by contemporary artists living and working in Ireland including Catherine Barron, James Horan, Ramon Kassam, Alison Lowry, Séamus O’Brien, Noel O’Donoghue, Laurence O’Toole, Csilla Toldy, Duc Van Pham, Síle Walsh and Lee Welch.\n\nLastly, the WGOA SETU Graduate Award Commission, will officially launch the newly commissioned portrait of Olympic silver medal winner John Treacy, by recent SETU Waterford Visual Arts Graduate, Sammy Kane.",

    "description": "Cork-based artists Deirdre Frost and Seiko Hayase collaborate in producing a cross-cultural exhibition Civilisation Blooming / 文明開花, a project that sees the two artists venture into new media and establish a synergistic practice. 文明開花 means 'civilisation' in Japanese, and is written using characters that mean 'blooming culture'. 'Bloom' can be considered a positive, when something has flowered, is in it's prime or at it's peak. However an algal bloom for example can be considered a negative event, a sign of ecological imbalance. Looking at the idea of peak humanity in this Anthropocene age, with the potential collapse of multiple organisational systems looming globally, the artists consider the idea of civilisation blooming. Featuring painting, woodblock prints, sculpture, ceramics and stop-frame animation. Opening hours on Culture Night 16.00-20.00. Exhibition tours 18.00 & 19.00. No booking required.",

Through narratives and historical references, the work speaks to the complexity of who has access to leisure, and why.\n\nFor more details please visit the Mermaid Arts Centre website: https://www.mermaidartscentre.ie\n\nNo booking is required for this exhibition.",

    "description": "On Culture Night 2024, Leitrim Sculpture Centre will bring together exhibitions, technical demo’s, open studios; the Chluinin co-op shop and local food in an evening that celebrates some of the diverse art forms practised across the County and the North West. Exhibition: Artist in Residence Katheryn Maguire will present To the Mountain in the gallery on New Line from 5 – 9pm. To the Mountain is Maguire's first solo show, which explores how the mapping of Mountains was developed in Ireland to ascertain the 'underground potential' of geological material value and to facilitate taxation. The mapping was done by triangulation and by creating a series of primary triangles. Sightings were taken between stations using theodolites.\n\nThis, and the artist's question, 'Do Mountains commune with us?' has inspired the fabrication of the exhibition including text, sculpture, video and installation works which continues until Saturday, Sept. 21st 4 pm. Technical demonstrations with public participation include Stone motifs & letter-cutting by Dominic Keogh of memento-mori; Ceramic form and glaze work by Herbie McCann; Metal casting by Kate Oram; Printmaking by Liz Byrne & Phoebe Dick and a variety of woodworking techniques for musical instruments and furniture by David Spence. Open studios include Caoimhe Guckian; Baibre Kennedy, John Byrne and international artist-in-residence Jude Griebel from the USA (all of the above at LSC factory New Line between 6pm – 8pm when local food and refreshments will be served). In addition, the Cluainín Community Co-operative Shop on Main Street will highlight the work of over 50 practitioners in the North West from 5-9pm, all work is for sale and at the factory on New Line between 6 – 8pm\n\nNo booking required and all welcome.",

Lets Draw is funded by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and is part of the ongoing development and enhancement of Galway City's thriving Night-Time Economy.\n\nLet's Draw will transform Galway's iconic Spanish Arch into an interactive canvas where the public becomes the artist. Taking place from 9PM pm to midnight participants of all ages are invited to use their smartphones as drawing tools. Creations will be projected in real-time onto the Comerford House building, forming a tapestry of light and colour that evolves with each stroke.\n\nRenowned French artist and technologist Maxime Touroute has developed the cutting-edge technology that powers this interactive experience. His intuitive web-based interface allows anyone, regardless of artistic ability, to contribute to the collective artwork. Special guest artists from the Galway Cartoon Festival will participate alongside the public, offering guidance and inspiration. Themed drawing prompts will encourage collaboration and ignite a shared sense of creativity.\n\nLet’s Draw is open to everyone, regardless of artistic experience.\n\nA limited number of drawing devices will be available for those without smartphones.",

    "description": "Internationally acclaimed duo, Christine Tobin singer-songwriter and Phil Robson guitarist present a film and music event called ‘Letters Home’. The documentary film celebrates those who emigrated to find work in the U.K. and farther afield during the second half of the 20th century. Hear the stories of six people from the Boyle, Frenchpark and Ballaghaderreen area, recorded in their own voices, interwoven with live music, song and a visual backdrop of images & photographs that recount their experiences, stretching from the 1960’s to the 1990’s. The subjects interviewed include legendary and much loved Boyle veteran Christy Wynne. Christine and Phil created the film based on their accounts of life then, both at home in Ireland and in the countries they travelled to in search of work. The title Letters Home is an acknowledgement of the important contribution emigrants made to the Irish economy by sending money back home to their families during this period.\nChristine Tobin grew up in Dublin and later became an integral part of the London contemporary music scene for many years, then moved to NYC in 2015 where she became part of the city’s creative music world before returning to Ireland in 2020. Awards include a BASCA British Composer Award, an Edinburgh Festival Herald Angel Award, a BBC Jazz Award & a UK Parliamentary Jazz Award.\nPhil Robson is a UK born, multi-award winning jazz guitarist/composer who has played with many legends of that music internationally as well as",

Over the course of a few days, Deirdre took pictures of 32 women and children at The Playhouse.\n\nPortraits of women and children ranging in age from 8 weeks to 108 will be displayed.

It features contemporary classical string quartet instrumentals fused with singer-songwriter melodies on piano and guitar, creating a gothic atmosphere that underscores the gaming concept. Butterfly Wars follows the story of goth AI X, who grapples with the question: am I the seed of AI or the embodiment of the human spirit?\n\nThis is chapter one, set on the planet Mysteria, a dark and wild place way, way off above the clouds. The concept work will be performed by Lou McMahon with an ensemble of string musicians in the Glor foyer. This is a stripped-back version of the live show which sometimes features a contemporary dancer. It is a work of haunting abstraction.\n\n\"A Magnificent Song [Mysteria]\" — RTVS (Radio and Television of Slovakia)",

This Culture Night Dublin event is an excellent opportunity to talk first-hand to the artist and to view her work in the special environment in which it was created.\n\nThe studio, located on Henrietta Street - Dublin's earliest Georgian street dating back to the mid-1720s - has been a vibrant hub for artists since around 1975. Unfortunately, as of July 2025, the studios will cease and no longer host artists. This marks the end of a remarkable era of creativity on this historic street.",

Let your imagination be guided by the flora and the fauna found in your surroundings. Our experienced instructors will guide you through the process, making sure you leave with a one-of-a-kind piece to cherish.\nBring your own plants (or anything else!) that you want to use to leave an impression on clay. We will be using a shape cutter to neatly shape the pendants. You will then be able to colour these using Englobes, if you wish!\n\nThe charms you have made will be fired, glazed with a see-through glaze and returned to you once the workshop is done by Aoife Natsumi. Your Porcelain Pendants will be ready for pick-up on the first weekend of October! Once you have it back, you can pick whatever chain or cord you like to turn it into a necklace.\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to get crafty and unleash your inner artist! We have a limited capacity so don't be slow in making a booking!\n(We won't be providing alcohol, but if you like you can bring your own little drink to get the creative juices flowing!)\n\nEventbrite link coming soon.\n\n*If you find this event to be full, please give ForgeClay@gmail.com an email to be put on the waiting list in case of cancellation.

Giving a high energy performance with impactful lyricism, his dynamic songs are both personal and urgent, and are sure to both make you move and touch your heart. Make sure to catch JyellowL’s set on Culture Night for an inspiring, explosive fusion of genres.\n\nJYellowL is a RTÉ Choice Music Prize nominated artist who has been consistently paving the way in Irish hip hop over the past number of years. The achievements speak for themselves, from supporting artists like Burna Boy, De La Soul, Nelly and The Game, to placements among the likes of the official FIFA soundtrack, Normal People and 1.2 million streams on Spotify alone in 2023 - all as an independent artist. His Irish, Jamaican and Nigerian roots have shaped his powerful, distinct sound and the Dublin-London based rapper is known for his effortless flow and music rooted in rap but fused with afrobeat, dancehall, RnB and soul.\n\nThis event is part of an expansive programme at Meeting House Square for Culture Night Dublin.

The name is a nod toward a beautiful affinity of Mexican and Irish cultures, represented by the soulful gritos of Ireland's only full mariachi.\n\nThe ensemble has travelled all over the island of Ireland sharing and honouring the beauty of mariachi music.

During the session you'll get a taste of set dancing, learn some steps, and (hopefully) meet some new people! Taught by a queer woman, Queer Set Dancing is open to everyone regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity but is specifically inclusive of LGBTQI+ people and their allies.\n\nAlexa Moore is an Ulster woman working to advance rights and equality for LGBTQI+ people. She moved to Belfast in 2018 to run a trans human rights organisation before moving on to work on issues relating to Brexit and human rights, eventually landing at The Rainbow Project earlier this year as their Policy, Campaigns and Communications Manager. She has been running Queer Set Dancing in The MAC, Belfast, for the past 2 and a half years, having set it up to share her love of set dancing and help keep it alive across the island.\n\nThis is a 16+ event. The class has been structured for individuals of this age and above in mind.\n\nArtwork by Fiona McDonnell.\n\nThis event is part of an expansive programme at Meeting House Square for Culture Night Dublin.

Along the way, you can join Una and try out different stims to feel through some big emotions and save fairy freedom!\n\n‘Squish Stomp Spin - The Magic of Stim’ was originally produced for Sensoria 2024.

His work, in both English and Irish, includes five novels, 20 stage plays (one of which toured in Afghanistan), a dozen radio dramas (on BBC and RTÉ), a blog [see: https://breathingwithalimp.blogspot.com ] plus an Oscar-nominated short film.\n\nNo previous writing experience is necessary but a desire to write a personal or family memory is.

Jacko, his hapless friend Podi, a wise old wizard and a host of small creatures from mice to snails, will enthral the audience in fifty minutes of adventure and misadventure.\n\nJacko, the brains and ambition of the outfit, is very put out when woolly-jumpered Podi comes down with a cold, threatening his dream of becoming rich and famous. Coming across a spellbook belonging to a mysterious wizard, Jacko, in his efforts to cure Podi, inadvertently turns him into a scary monster and a series of small creatures all of whom the children agree sing better than himself.\n\nA clever blend of pantomimic farce, puppetry and storytelling is wonderfully pitched to engage children’s imagination and draw them into the plot. (adapted from Irish Theatre Magazine).",

We'll stomp and rattle our way from the park to the Catholic church in a lantern-lit procession.\n\nThis will be followed by a concert in the Church from 8pm with local musicians and singers including the East Clare Community Choir and Lough Derg Singers, Cormac Griffith on his Glass Harp, Slow Creatures (a wonderful young local trio), and Cli Donnellan, who will perform the world premiere of her piece, 'Walk with Me', composed especially for our theme, ''Harmony''.\n\nConclude the evening with a special 'A Flow of Words' featuring local writers and poets who have composed pieces around our theme which will also be broadcast on Scariff Bay Radio on Saturday, September 21 and Sunday, September 22. This segment will beautifully weave together the night’s celebration of harmony through music and spoken word.",

Part of the Pause series, MTU Cork School of Music is honoured to host a new visual art exhibition.\n\nDrama Platform Showcase: Stack Theatre, 19:00 - 20:00.\nFeaturing recent graduates and current students of the BA in Theatre and Drama Studies degree at MTU Cork School of Music.

As part of Culture Night, this small and interactive exhibit wants YOU to participate too! Blank postcards have been provided so that anyone in Cork – of local or migrant background – can draw, write and remember the lullabies you hold most dear. By highlighting the emotions and values that we have in common, we can promote integration and inclusion for everyone in the Cork community.",

    "description": "Catriona McElhinney Grimes Piano and Violin\n\n“McElhinney Grimes played all the works with a loving attention to detail; and a range of approach that encompassed both the extreme of ferocity and the finest of filigree”.\n\"The piece that wooed the ear more than it tried to impress was Takemitsu’s Rain Tree Sketch, in which individual notes sometimes took on the quality of precious stones. “ The Irish Times, National Concert Hall, Solo piano recital review.\n\nCatriona grew up in the North West of Ireland as part of a musical family, and gave her first concert performance at the age of six. She was introduced to the piano by her mother and was awarded an entrance scholarship to the Royal Irish Academy of Music at the age of ten and subsequently went on to win many major awards at Dublin Feis Ceoil, and Fleadh Cheoil as a traditional musician. Her teachers and mentors have included Brian Beckett, Antony Peebles, Alexander Ardakov, Ruth David and Korshed Gruenberg.\n\nCatriona’s versatility as an artist is reflected in the diverse repertoire she performs. She feels equally at home playing Bach, Beethoven, passionate and expressive romantic music,contemporary pop and Irish Trad on piano, fiddle and tin whistle.\nCatriona recently successfully completed her Master’s degree in Performance with Distinction at TU Dublin Conservatory of Music and Drama.",

So much so that when school books were being burned at the end of the school year, Soundings was always spared the flames. It touched the lives of every student that opened it.\n\nSo on Culture Night 2024, we invite you to join poet, Cormac Lally at Myo Cafe to share with us a bit about your experiences with this marvelous anthology and read your favourite poem.",

    "description": "Immram is a setting by Neil Ó Lochlainn for chamber ensemble, reciter, and singer of the Immram suite of poems written by Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill and published in her collection Feis (1991). The music was commissioned by Paddy Bushe and the Amergin Solstice Poetry Gathering in 2019. The term 'Immram' meaning Voyage, is a type of tale found in mythological Irish writing that depicts a protagonist's sea journey to the otherworld and the adventures that ensue.\n\nThis musical suite seamlessly merges the sean nós tradition, jazz/improvised music, and contemporary chamber music, creating an innovative style of contemporary Irish music that is deeply rooted in Ireland's rich singing and dance traditions.\n\nThe performance features a stellar ensemble of highly regarded musicians: Eithne Ní Chatháin on voice, Lucia Mac Partlin on fiddle, Eilís Lavelle on harp, and Neil Ó Lochlainn on double bass and flute.\n\n“Neil Ó Lochlainn has an instinct and a feel for different strands of music that allows him to create uncompromised musical worlds that speak with real depth and authenticity” Martin Hayes",

    "description": "Irish PEN/PEN na hÉireann and Wicklow Arts Office present an international poetry reading from poets Sean Borodale, Jane Clarke and Viviana Fiorentino.\n\nPoetry from the Edge reflects on climate change, nature and how poetry and words can inspire change. Three poets celebrate internationality, all the more needed at this time when we see hostility and division growing all over the world.\n\nViviana Fiorentino grew up in Italy and has made her home in Co. Wicklow. Jane Clarke also lives in Co. Wicklow and Sean Borodale has recently moved to Co. Sligo from England. They will read from their work, inspired by the natural world and exploring environmental loss and restoration.\n\nBIO\nSean Borodale works as an artist, poet, writer. He was the visiting Oscar Wilde Fellow at Trinity College Dublin in 2016. He was selected as a Granta New Poet in 2012 and a Poetry Book Society Next Generation Poet in 2014. He has four collections of poetry published with Jonathan Cape. His first, Bee Journal (2012), was shortlisted for the TS Eliot Prize and Costa Book Award. Other collections are Human Work, Asylum and Inmates. Mighty Beast, a documentary poem for BBC Radio 3 about cattle markets and modern farming practices, won a Radio Academy Gold Award for Best Feature or Documentary. His topographical poem Notes for an Atlas (Isinglass 2007), written whilst walking around London, was adapted and directed as a perform\nJane Clarke is the author of three poetry collections, The River (2015), When the Tree Falls (2019) and A Change in the Air (2023) published by Bloodaxe Books. Jane’s poems explore what it means to connect with each other and our surroundings through times of cultural and environmental upheaval. She edited the illustrated anthology Windfall: Irish Nature Poems to Inspire and Connect (Hachette Books Ireland, 2023). Her most recent collection, A Change in the Air, was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize 2023, the Forward Prize for Best Collection 2023 and the Farmgate Café National Poetry Award 2024 and was also longlisted for the Laurel Prize for eco-poetry.\nViviana Fiorentino is originally from Italy. She graduated at the Seamus Heaney Centre (Queen’s University) with a MA in Poetry. She translated Irish poet Freda Laughton into Italian (Arcipelago Itaca, 2022), Doireann Ní Ghríofa (VersoDove, 2024), Paula Meehan (Il Pietrisco, 2023) and Layli Long Soldier (Verodove, 2023). One of her essays on Anne Carson appeared in the volume Trasparenze 8/22 of San Marco dei Giustiniani (2022). Her poems in English appeared in anthologies (Dedalus Press, Salmon Poetry, Arlen House) magazines (i.e. The Stinging Fly, Banshee Press), on public transports in Dublin (Poetry Ireland), on air for RTÉ 1 and in the The Irish Poetry Reading Archive. In Italy she published a novel and two poetry collections. She is 2022 Irish Chair Of Poetry Student Prize winner and finalist in the Gregory O’Donoghue Poetry Competition 2024.

    "description": "As part of Galway Culture Night, the Amnesty Galway Group are planning an event with two parts: the first part is a talk by our Executive Director, Stephen Bowen, the second part is a postcard campaign for political prisoners in Russia.\n\nStephen will talk about Amnesty’s work in general and more particularly about human rights violations in Europe and Russia. Following the war in Ukraine, the Russian parliament has introduced war censorship laws to impede any criticism against the invasion by making it a grave offence. Several people are serving lengthy prison sentences for peaceful anti-war dissent. Unfortunately, other European parliaments are passing laws to restrict the right of peaceful assembly and protesting. Amnesty International has a campaign, called “Protect the Protest”, to raise awarness in the wide community about this worrisome trend. As part of this campaign, Amnesty advocates on behalf of Russians who have been imprisoned by the Russian authorities for their various protests against the War in Ukraine.\n\nThe local Galway Amnesty Volunteer Group will provide postcards of Galway with messages written in Russian to stick to the postcards. We will invite people to choose a message, stick the message to the postcard, add a drawing if they like and sign the postcards. We will also have markers for those who want to draw a visual message. These postcards will be posted to the Russian prisoners of conscience that are serving several-year sentences in prison just for exercising their right to protest the war in Ukraine.",

Several works in the show are unfinished, damaged, or refer to research in progress or artworks that were never made; others were never intended to be seen as art and have been gathered for this presentation only.\n\nArtists include Buddhist Third Class Junkmail Oracle, Ian Burn, Gerard Byrne, Janine Davidson, Jacob Epstein, Emma Finucane, Breda Lynch, Fiona Mc Donald, Emily Mc Gardle, [O+F+C], Kathy Prendergast, and Elizabeth Price.\n\nCommissioned by Black Church Print Studio.",

The event is suitable for all ages and levels of ability, and is taught by professional cartoonists. It requires you to bring nothing except an imagination - everything else, including pencils and paper, will be provided.\n\nThe games and activities involve expressing ideas both visually and verbally, and exploring how humour arises from the unexpected collision of concepts and the subversion of everyday expectations. As such they are really more exercises in creative thinking than just lessons in drawing.\n\nThe event takes place ahead of the Culture Night Late \"Let's Draw\", to which the Galway Cartoon Festival has also contributed, and our hope is that older participants in our workshop will stay up a bit longer to join in the fun at the Spanish Arch.",

    "description": "\"Mind blowing.\"\n\"Brilliant.\"\n\"I will never look at these streets the same again.\"\n\nUsing stories of local buildings and places, Richard Carson invites participants to reimagine our relationships with the place and with one another. Using history, theology and much more, we will encounter how the colonial imagination was established in the place of the north east inner city and is still yet to be exorcised.\n\nThis 90-minute walking tour of Lower Gardiner Street and its laneways has featured on RTÉ Lyric FM, Culture Night 2023 and with numerous schools, colleges and community groups. New features for 2024 include a local wedding that united two settings of 19th century colonialism from opposite sides of the world and how what happened at the site of Store St. Garda Station over 250 years ago reminds us that so-called “new communities” are not so new after all.\n\nMeeting point: Custom House, South Facade, beside the river, D01 W6X0",

    "description": "An virtual exhibition by Nua Collective.\n\nLaunching on Culture Night, Friday 20th September at 7pm on www.nuacollective.ie/scatter.\n\nAcross diverse contexts—whether in the shifting patterns of the sky, the migration of people, the application of paint, or the passage of time — there exists a universal experience of scattering. As humans, we find ourselves dispersed by forces both external and internal, whether through geographic relocation, emotional distance, or the natural progression of life.\n\nYet, within this scattering lies a profound potential for reconnection. Our roots, relationships, and shared histories form intricate networks that, despite physical or emotional distances, continue to bind us together. This process of scattering and reuniting, of shedding the old to embrace the new, reflects the dynamic and resilient nature of the human experience. Whether scattered by choice or circumstance, we carry within us the threads that link us back to our origins, to each other, and to the ever-present possibility of reconnection.\n\nOriginal artworks created specifically for this concept collection by Nua Collective artists Anne Martin Walsh, Caoimhe Heaney, John Murray, Josh Stein, Katrīna Tračuma, Maria Markham, Robert Jackson, Saoirse O'Sullivan, Eamonn B. Shanahan, Lucy Lambe and Christina Geoghegan.\n\nJoin us for our free launch event. There are limited spaces available for our private zoom showcase - please sign up through the following link: www.nuacollective.ie/scatter/\n\nEstablished in 2020, Nua Collective is a visual arts collective providing a space that supports artists, shares their work and starts conversation",

    "description": "Secret Sonic Cinematheque is a unique presentation of short silent movies or excerpts of movies with a live score performed by the SSC ensemble. The movies span a broad range from documentaries to fantastic imaginings to experimental processes.\n\nThe audience will experience a wide and varied series of sights and sounds as the group works through their prescribed works along with a number of ‘surprise’ films, chosen with the participation of the audience. In our efforts to make the events as site-specific as possible we like to source a movie from a local filmmaker, where possible as well as using local guest composers in our ensemble.\n\nEach composer picks a movie to score in whatever manner they see fit, from total improvisation to guided improvisation to fully realised composed works, to be realised by some or all of the musicians, as required by the composer.\n\nOur core composers (Andy Mooney and Diarmuid MacDiarmada) facilitate the guest composers in any way they can in the realisation of their ideas. Andrew Edgar is our very entertaining compere who brings in an element of audience participation with regard to the choice of films that the group will respond to, sight-unseen.\n\nThe audience invariably understands that the Secret Sonic Cinematheque is an artistic tight-rope walk and tends to be very engaged in the nail-biting drama unfolding before them.\n\nThis is a free first-come-first-served event.\nDoors 8pm, and show starts at 8:30pm sharp.",

The aim is to represent two future outcomes, possible progress and the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe “worst-case scenario” is a future in which the domestic wool industry has plummeted, increased rainfall has led to the collapse of cattle farming, biodiversity is beyond extinction level, invasive species and reduction of native woodlands cause water quality disasters, depopulation accelerates, closure of schools and local services and the area is abandoned.\n\nThe “possible progress” is a future in which tradition meets innovation where traditional sustainable farming methods are hybridised biodiversity caretaking enterprises. This new custodianship not only leads to an increase of biodiversity and carbon capturing, but also to the locality flourishing with a co-operative economy. As the local economy grows, offering new forms of meitheal and income from progressive agricultural methods for future generations of farmers. This a future based on pre-industrial Ireland in which the community, local economy and natural ecosystem are synchronised for the betterment of all.\n\nThis installation hopes to spark conversation in upland communities around their future and the power they have to make it a positive one through their collective decisions.\n\nAn té nach gcuireann san earrach ní bhaineann sé san fhómhar.",

The screening will be accompanied by a live-score, played over segments of pre-recorded compositions for each film, using vintage synthesizers, field recordings, theremin, pipe chimes, and autoharp.\n\nThese short films/animations and TV ads of the period explore the themes of the 50's and 60's space-race through the lens of culture.\n\nThe cold war between the US and the USSR displayed competing visions of the future which shaped the horizons of everyday experience, influencing popular culture through film, leisure, architecture, design and fashion, as well as peoples’ overall perceptions of the future which were often fantasies of a highly technological society with fantastical gadgetry, virtual worlds, robots, space colonies and interstellar travel.\n\nFilms like 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) opened up a new market for science-fiction blockbusters like Star Wars, Alien, Close Encounters and Bladerunner. Disney transformed its theme parks to include a variety of space-themed amusements such as 'Astro Orbiter' and 'Space Mountain'.",

They chart the relationship between Ireland and England over the centuries through coded romance, rejection, seduction and exile.\n\nThey mirror the landscape itself, and have travelled the byways of the British Isles laying down songlines as they are passed from voice to voice. Presenting Irish and English folk songs with Gaelic Sean Nos singing, Songlines explores thematic links within and between songs of these musical traditions which themselves are intertwined and share common heritage.\n\nThe performance will feature songs collected by Susie in Connemara as well as music made popular by the likes of Seosaimh O’Heanaigh, Margaret Barry, Annie Briggs, June Tabor and others.",

    "description": "\"The Taney Bell Ringers are a group in Dundrum, Dublin that practice the traditional art of full-circle change ringing. This is a method of ringing where bells are rung by hand in a series of varying sequences under the direction of a conductor.\n\nIn this form of ringing, bells in the Church steeple are mounted on a headstock attached to a large wheel attached to a rope. When the ringer pulls the rope at the bottom of the tower, this turns the wheel, causing the bell to swing and then rotate in a full circle. The bell rotates from top to bottom and back again - sounding a chime at each end of the rotation.\n\nFull circle change ringing can be traced to the early 17th century. Since then, mechanical systems have replaced most teams of ringers - Taney is one of just five steeples in Dublin that are still rung by hand.\n\nThe bell tower at Taney houses a set of bells from St George's Church on Hardwicke Street. These bells were first commissioned by architect Francis Johnston for his own use in a full-size steeple he built at the end of his garden. His neighbours persuaded him to donate the bells to a church, so they were moved to St. George's in 1828. After St George's was deconsecrated in 1990, these bells were rescued and stored until their installation at Taney in 2000.\n\nFor Culture Night, we will host three open ringing sessions where visitors can listen to a team ring, then try sounding a bell themselves.\"",

Founded in 1758, the original Venetian styled church was destroyed on June 4th 1922 in the Battle of Dublin. Through a government compensation scheme, a brand new church was built and opened on the site in 1931. This church was paid for by the exchequer, making it the only Protestant church in Ireland funded by Irish Free State taxpayers. The Parish has seen many changes in North Dublin's residential, economic and cultural life. Indeed it has recently restructured and reopened its church, following a period of reorganisation.\n\nCome and see this fascinating oasis located just off Dublin's main thoroughfare, O'Connell Street, this Culture Night.",

St. Patrick’s Band was the first group to be heard on the first outside broadcast -Radio 2RN- that came from Galway in 1927.\n\nIt is the Band’s ambition and vision to continue the work of keeping brass alive and preserving it into the future and for future generations of players and audience members. The Senior band meets and rehearses every Friday night and on Culture Night we open our doors to the general public so they can see how we are keeping brass alive in Galway.\nCome and see our Bandroom, a wonderful centre for music in the heart of Galway. It is also home to a number of publicly funded groups such as choirs, dance organisations and other similar cultural groups which the band supports.\n\nCome and see our Bandroom, a wonderful centre for music in the heart of Galway.

The film was shot over three nights at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles, when the band was promoting their album Speaking in Tongues, which was to give them their smash hit Burning Down the House.\n\nThe pairing of director Jonathan Demme and David Byrne proved inspired. Demme’s refusal to show audience reaction until late in the performance creates an immersive experience for the viewer as both the stage set and the band are gradually constructed around Byrne following his shy opening announcement, ‘I’ve got a tape I wanna play’.\n\n1984, 88 minutes, PG",

    "description": "Strata is a new exhibition at CCA Derry~Londonderry by artists Marie Farrington, Dorothy Hunter and Amy Stephens. The artworks in the show explore layers of interconnected themes and lines of enquiry exploring geology, extraction, value and thresholds. The three artists use a range of media including photography, sculpture, film and new site-specific installations and interventions.\n\nExhibition open until 6pm. After hours you can see our live studio used by emerging artists through the windows of our street-facing Project Space and the latest risograph edition in our Window Text series.\n\nStrata - The Artists:\n\nDorothy Hunter’s work concerns the use of time as a political tool and has a long-term interest in chronopolitics (time and its reading as a political force). She is interested in how we relate to land and geology, with recent work exploring mapped and unseen space in Cuilcagh Lakelands Geopark, the world’s first transnational geopark that has an extensive subterranean cave network. The new body of work developed for Strata includes friezes inspired by the plaster rococo adornment of palladian stately homes, two architectural principles that married in Ireland in ordered, symmetrical re-presentations of natural splendour on interior walls. Using the architectural overhangs of CCA’s Gallery 2 as a stand-in for both the grand house and the caverns of the geopark, drawing from the plaster decoration of Florence Court (home to the 3rd Earl of Enniskillen who invited this land's first documented exploration), Dorothy is referencing inherited dominion and representation of land, and its murky anarchy in underground space.\n\nAmy Stephens’ works are underpinned by geology and travel. She uses photography, collage and everyday materials such as tape to generate new perspectives about time and our appreciation of the landscape. She elevates artefacts through their manipulation, juxtaposing materials and textures. For Amy, she writes, “Rocks and minerals have their own story, but the abundance of any object can be a source of invisibility.”[1] Amy’s work features pristine, often polished stones on pedestals or photographed and presented in constructed frames, urging reflection upon the nature of extraction, time and human creation.\n\nMarie Farrington’s practice reflects on the act of making through geological and archaeological lenses. Using casting, carving, and other sculptural processes, she engages with memory through situated encounters with landscape and architecture. Her work makes formal reference to field sampling, built heritage and histories of display. For Strata, Marie has made a series of interactive carved soapstone forms, which she invites the audience to lift and rearrange. They are accompanied in gallery 3 by new works in anthracite clay. Other new works in cold-bent steel, and slumped and cast glass are concentrated around the thresholds of the exhibition spaces.",

    "description": "Join the Taiwan Centre for Mandarin Learning in Ireland at the Savoy Cinema for an unforgettable evening 4 as they present ‘Invisible Nation’ (2023), a documentary exploring Taiwan's transformation from an authoritarian state to a vibrant democracy.\n\nFocusing on President Tsai Ing-wen's efforts to maintain Taiwan's autonomy amid political isolation, ‘Invisible Nation’ is directed and co-produced by Vanessa Hope. This film contrasts Taiwan's democratic achievements with its diplomatic struggles, using interviews and historical footage to highlight Taiwan's journey, the tension with China's territorial claims, and the potential for conflict. Despite these challenges, Taiwan has made significant reforms, like legalising same-sex marriage and promoting human rights. The documentary is timely and thought-provoking, drawing parallels with Ukraine and Hong Kong, and leaving viewers to ponder Taiwan's uncertain future.",

Local system Rub A Dub Hifi as well as inviting an incredible lineup of DJs will be playing all kinds of dub, from reggae, dubstep, jungle, dnb and more. MC Mad X will be hosting the night and bringing her fierce energy to the room!\n\nOver the years Rub A Dub Hi-Fi have brought their sound to festivals across the country. Curating and powering many stages at different festivals and events. After launching their new bass music night in 2018 called Subconscious they held events hosting Parly B, Jacky Murda, Mr. Williamz, Brother Culture and to finish the year they brought Deep Medi don Mala for a night no one will forget. In November 2019 they hosted Channel One Soundsystem who have pioneered soundsystem culture for 40+ years.\n\nMC and Sing-Jay Artist Mad-X from South London, has been performing at festivals, private parties, dances, stage shows and clubs for over 20 years, both nationally and internationally. Mad-X's raw and unapologetic style was cultivated from an early age in the shebeems and dancehalls of 90s South London.\n\nAs an MC, Mad-X style is a great accompaniment to most music genres but is undoubtedly heavily influenced from her early days in reggae, dub and 80s/90s dancehall. Merged with current styles of MC’ing Mad-X goal is to perform on the biggest stages of the world. To date such stages include; Notting Hill Carnival, Leicester Carnival, Scala nightclub, Hootananny Brixton, and other clubs, festivals and dancehalls throughout the UK and Europe.\n\nSet times:\n22.00-23.00 Chonkie (Rub A Dub Hifi)\n23.00-00.00 Governess\n00.00-01.00 Ciara May & Kelsey\n01.00-2.00 Jonezy\n2.00-3.00 Ambit\n\nYamamori Tengu opened its doors to dancers in 2013. Adorned with genuine Japanese artefacts, the club is overlooked by the legendary creature ‘tengu’, a mischievous supernatural being. Warm lights, friendly faces and a bar stocked with both local and Japanese beverages create a unique atmosphere. Tengu’s dance floor has been an integral part of Irish nightlife for almost a decade for the ravers, music lovers and everyone in between.",

    "description": "Terra Fabula is a series of eight paintings, along with supporting materials (photographs, sketches, reports), which explores a complex and fractured narrative. The collection explores the conflict between the ancient, natural world and our modern, industry heavy society.\n\nAs an exhibition, I envision it as an immersive experience, with the various elements portraying a cruel indifference towards life, and is an attempt to depict the often incomprehensibly horrific consequences of those actions. Terra Fabula is a conceptual, narrative collection. Each painting acts as a chapter in the narrative with an accompanying, albeit censored report detailing the experiment and its results. Each chapter also includes photographs and sketches which fill out the narrative. As the experiments continue, the organism reacts in increasingly strange and hostile ways, becoming more and more degraded and toxic.\n\nIn each chapter the painting becomes more and more corrupted and polluted. This is represented through changes in colour and texture, as can be seen in the accompanying sketches as well as my previous work. Each painting will be a combination of acrylic paint, resin, mixed media items, and multiple canvases layered with the aim of creating an ethereal, otherworldly presence.",

    "description": "\"Do you have a caring disposition or are you in need of caring? The Blue Star is the answer! Meet the savvy Martina, the charming Phildelma and the wallflower Ciara at the Town Hall Theatre Bar on the 20th of September at 6pm and hear how their input made the Galway Branch of The Blue Star the award-winning care agency we know and love today. The Blue Star is a comic yet moving play that asks some tough questions about the Irish homecare system and how we perceive caring.\n\nPlaywright Aoibheann McCann says “Caring is an issue that affects more and more of my friends as I get older.” We each have our personal challenging obstacles to deal with in caring for each other and ourselves and we constantly question whether this is even possible. It is this weighty life question that this play embraces and which makes these three women such fascinating characters to meet.\n\nExcerpts of The Blue Star will be performed by stalwarts of the Irish Theatre community: Tara Breathnach (Martina), Sorcha Fox (Phildelma) and Brídín Nic Dhonncha (Ciara). Directed and dramaturged by Mairéad Folan (NoRopes Theatre Company). This event is in partnership with Town Hall Theatre, Galway. A Q&A with the creative team, chaired by Fergal McGrath (Venue Director, Town Hall Theatre) will follow the performance.\n\nTickets available from Town Hall Theatre www.tht.ie from Fri 6 Sept, 10am\n\nLocation: Upstairs in Town Hall Theatre, Galway 1 Courthouse Square, Galway, H91 H3C2\n*this event is wheelchair accessible",

In this 40 minute talk she will give an overview of how colour works and will show examples of this with paintings from some of her favourite painters around the world. This talk is suitable for all, whether you have no knowledge of colour or are studying painting and/or are interested in learning about a topic which will help you to make your experience as a viewer more informed and enjoyable. It should give you an insight on how to ‘read’ a painting and what colour systems an artist was using whilst creating a piece.\n\nSiobhan will have a deletion of her own paintings on view and will also reveal her latest two portraits in her series ‘Roscommon Rising’. Last year she started the series with portraits of Douglas Hyde, Margaret (Gretta) Cousins and Chris O’Dowd.",

    "description": "This Culture Night, visitors to The Mansion House are invited to talk a walk through the public rooms of the Lord Mayor's official residence, built by Joshua Dawson and the scene of important civic and historic events for over 300 years. Come along to have an exclusive look inside the Oak Room, Drawing Room, Dining Room, and Lady Mayoress Parlour.\n\nThe Oak Room was built as a condition of the purchase agreement with Joshua Dawson. It is, as the name suggests, panelled entirely of oak, with some of the original panelling still in place. Designed over 300 years ago for civic receptions, it is still used for this purpose today. The room contains a number of fine portraits including that of Charles Stewart Parnell, founder of the Home Rule Party. Also on show here are individual coat-of-arms of Dublin’s Lord Mayors. Each Lord Mayor meets with the Chief Herald of Ireland, who is based in the National Library, to agree on a Coat of Arms reflecting their life.\n\nStaff will be on hand to assist visitors on their self-guided tour.",

Collective.\n\nSnoopy Dog Actual Dog is a very good 305-year-old Labradoodle - that’s 43.5 in human years. He likes long walks, various kinds of meat, shouting at delivery drivers and writing (and occasionally performing) works of short fiction. For Culture Night Dublin 2024, he will be telling a few stories from his soon-to-be published collection, entitled 'Asses I have sniffed and tears I have licked.' Snoopy Dog Actual Dog is a member of the Pay Attention! Collective of artists, members of whom he will be supported by on this wonderful night.\n\nThe Pay Attention! Collective meet every week in Ryan's of Store Street to share cool stories, poems and art, complaining about mediocre television and film and occasionally solving crimes and/or ghost-hunting.",

What kind of world Elisabeth St Leger was initiated into as a young girl in Doneraile court in 1713.\n\nDoneraile Court is inextricably linked to being the first place that a lady Freemason was initiated into the order in 1713.\nElisabeth Aldworth (nee St Leger) was only 17 when she inadvertently witnessed a Freemason meeting in Doneraile court in 1713.\n\nShe was initiated as a Freemason subsequently as the other consequences were unthinkable for a daughter of the house.\nElisabeth historically became the very first woman to be initiated into the order, and the first Lady Freemason.\nFreemasonry is often clouded with mystery and secrecy throughout the ages, we have invited members of the Provincial grand lodge of Munster to enlighten and clarify our perceptions of modern Freemasons.\n\nIf you would like to attend, we have 40 free tickets only, in celebration of Culture Night 2024\nThe event will start at 3pm and tickets are given out on a first come first served basis, starting at 2pm tickets will be given out from Doneraile Court ticket office.",

The workshop will start with a shadow puppet demonstration and then we invite you to create your own Gallowglass puppets and experiment with retelling the story in your own words.\n\nThis event is a chance for families to work together in doing something creative.

The FitzGerald family were at the height of musical culture in their time. In records from the 1500s, we see an organ-maker and a trumpeter in their rent book, and an Irish harper on retainer among their court. This concert illustrates the multicultural music landscape of medieval and early modern Ireland, and the contentious place of Irish music in constructing national identities in both Ireland and England.\n\nThe concert is free admission and will take place at 7pm on the 20th of September, in the castle's keep. Please note there are no toilets on site. Disability access to rear of building.\n\nProgramme:\nMaiden in the Mor Lay (Anon., English, 14th c.)\nIch Am of Irlaunde (Anon., English, 14th c.)\n\nLarga Manus Brigide (Extract from The Office of St. Brigid) (Anon.

    "description": "A Sound Art installation celebrating Fermoy's Cultural Diversity.\n\nThis is a collaboration between sound artist Duncan O'Cleirigh and Fermoy International Choir.\n\nWhile studying an MA in Experimental Sound Practice in UCC, the producer and sound\nartist Duncan O’Cleirigh started to explore the idea of extended drone-like sounds.\n\nFurther experimenting lead to the idea of a piece made entirely from voices.\nOften when people hear music, it is the sound of the voice, the melody, or the instrument\nthat draws them even if they do not understand the words. Singing is one of the oldest\nways in which we make music.\n\nThe idea of using a choir to be the source of the voices came about as a result of a chat\nbetween Duncan O’Cleirigh and Fermoy International Choir musical director Lisa Dunphy.\nThe choirs inclusive, positive ethos really fitted with the idea of a universally understood,\nvoice based sound art installation. This project celebrates our common humanity.\nIt also celebrates community. Diverse, bustling and bubbling with life.\n\nWe all have similar cares and joys in life. We are all one.\nThis piece has no words. It changes and shifts. Does it have a beginning or end? You are\ninvited to sit in the physical spaceman let the sounds wash past you.\n\nIt provides a sonic space to reflect on our shared human.\nTake a little time.\nPause, listen and think.",

That is, until she discovers that her older sister Phyllis is a secret suffragette! Mollie starts to realise just how unfair the world can be - and she wants to do something about it. When Mollie and her friend Nora get involved in the movement, they must face an important question: just how far should a girl go for her beliefs?\n\nThis charming and witty new play invites you to step into a very different time and join Mollie as she begins her journey to find her place in the world.\n\nFor children ages 8+.\n\nPlease note there is a Jotform link live to sign-up now on this page, but the links to stream will not be sent until 10am on September 20th. So we welcome early sign-ups now, but we will make sure the link and information for streaming is at the top of everyone’s inbox on the 20th September.

Directed by Claire Joyce, for Down at Heel Productions, it is a madcap, emotional, theatrical voyage through the early and late years of John Devoy’s life and asks the question – is liberty worth the sacrifice? Dubbed by the London Times as ‘The most dangerous enemy this country (UK) has produced since Wolfe Tone’, Kildare man, John Devoy wanted to lay down his life for Ireland. But his plans were thwarted when in 1871, he was banished to America as a traitor. Fifty-three years later, he arrived back to a hero’s welcome. He was, in Pearse’s words, ‘the greatest of all the fenians’. Come join us Down at Heel Productions on Culture Night for an extraordinary play about an extraordinary man – a man who lost all he loved and won it back again.",

    "description": "This presentation by artist Dolores Lyne will include a talk and a fine art exhibition, inspired by the letters of her granduncles, Liam and Tom Lynch, from 1917 to the final stages of the Civil War in 1923. While Liam became IRA chief of staff, Tom was a priest. Lyne decodes the letters, identifying their rural locations and contexts.\n\nThe presentation brings to life the human aspect of the Civil War, highlighting one family's struggle in the context of the national struggle. Lynch’s grandniece provides unique insights into her subjects’ thinking , and should prove fascinating to those interested in revolutionary period. She also presents a unique personal perspective on Lynch.\n\nLyne’s large canvasses evoke the folded letters of the brothers and follow the journey of the dispatches back to the safe houses where they were written. The source material for the exhibition is a trove of family letters, now in the National Library of Ireland’s collection. The bicycle in one of the paintings may have been the actual one used to deliver the message as the owner acted as an intelligence officer during the War of Independence.",

    "description": "Toil and Moil is a solo exhibition by artist Emma Swan, alongside a showcase of the Celebrate People’s History poster series, a project initiated by Josh MacPhee.\n\nToil and Moil is an exhibition featuring painting, sculpture and sound, exploring the significance of time and labour in the work environment. Swan investigates how the introduction of the Henry Ford assembly line revolutionised manufacturing, industry, and society by accelerating productivity. By looking at the repetitive and monotonous nature of industrialised labour, Swan references these practices to protest against the regimented structure of the working day, highlighting the limitations imposed and its prevailing influence.\n\nThis exhibition prompts a conversation about labour and workers’ conditions, while facilitating an opportunity to platform strike action and global protest. The Celebrate People’s History poster series demonstrates a DIY tradition that centralises principles of democracy, inclusion and collective action. The project has been organised and curated by Josh MacPhee since 1998, he is a founding member of the Justseeds Artists’ Cooperative and Interference Archive, a public collection of cultural materials produced by social movements based in Brooklyn, NY. Justseeds Artists’ Cooperative is a decentralised network of 41 artists from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, committed to social, environmental and political engagement. The collection is kindly borrowed from artist and organiser Kate O’Shea.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Rachel Botha.\nDesign by Emmet Brown.\n\n–\n\nEmma Swan is an installation artist based in Dublin, Ireland.

Carefully curated images will highlight how today, Turlough Hill captures and stores surplus energy generated by wind and solar power, thereby supporting ESBs ‘Net Zero by 2040’ strategy.\n\nAs well as this bespoke exhibition, visitors to Turlough Hill 50th Birthday Bash can enjoy poetry recitals by Chandrika Narayanan-Mohan, complimentary barista coffee & cupcakes served from the iconic ESB Volkswagen van or try their hand at generating their own kinetic energy!",

    "description": "Friends of Kilconly Wetlands invites you to 'Voices from the Bog', an evening celebrating the richness of our peatland heritage. Come along and immerse yourself in the natural wonders and cultural heritage of our bogs.\n\nThis unique event explores the rich tapestry of our bog landscape: the myths and folklore it has inspired, the culture of peat-harvesting it supported, and the delicate ecosystem it nurtures.\n\nLocal people will share oral histories and traditions, while poetry readings will explore the influence of the bog on Irish culture. Gain insights into wetland ecology from Professor Mike Gormally of the University of Galway and discover local creativity in an exhibition curated by artist Sarah Deane, featuring bog-inspired artwork and photographs from the community.\n\nThe evening culminates in a traditional Irish music session with local musicians. Join us for an unforgettable celebration of nature, history, and community spirit inspired by our local wetlands.",
